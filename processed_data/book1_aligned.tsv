THOMAS À KEMPIS: DE IMITATIONE CHRISTI LIBER PRIMUS	
Liber PrimusAdmonitiones ad Vitam spiritualem utiles.	THE FIRST BOOK ADMONITIONS PROFITABLE FOR THE SPIRITUAL LIFE
Cap. I.  De imitatione Christi et contemptu mundi omniumque eius vanitatum.	CHAPTER I Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities
1.Qui sequitur me non ambulat in tenebrisdicit Dominus. Hæc sunt verba Christi, quibus admonemur quatenus vitam eius et mores imitemur, si volumus veraciter illuminari, et ab omni cæcitate cordis liberari. Summum igitur studium nostrum, sit in vita Jesu meditari.	1. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, saith the Lord. These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.
2. Doctrina Ejus omnes doctrinas Sanctorum præcellit, et qui spiritum haberetabsconditum ibi mannainveniret. Sed contingit quod multi ex frequenti auditu Evangelii parvum desiderium sentiunt, quia spiritum Chrisi non habent. Qui autem vult plene et sapide verba Christi intelligere, oportet ut totam vitam suam illi studeat conformare.	2. His teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men, and such as have His Spirit find therein the hidden manna. But there are many who, though they frequently hear the Gospel, yet feel but little longing after it, because they have not the mind of Christ. He, therefore, that will fully and with true wisdom understand the words of Christ, let him strive to conform his whole life to that mind of Christ.
3. Quid prodest tibi alta de Trinitate disputare, si careas humilitate unde displiceas Trinitati? Vere alta verba non faciunt sanctum et justum, sed virtuosa vita efficit Deo carum. Opto magis sentire compunctionem quam scire definitionem. Si scires totam Bibliam, et omnium philosophorum dicta quid totum prodesset, sine charitate et gratia?Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitaspræter amare Deum et illi soli fervire. Ista est summa sapientia per contemptum mundi tendere ad regna cælestia.	3. What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion concerning the Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus displeasing to the Trinity? For verily it is not deep words that make a man holy and upright; it is a good life which maketh a man dear to God. I had rather feel contrition than be skilful in the definition thereof. If thou knewest the whole Bible, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit thee without the love and grace of God? Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, save to love God, and Him only to serve. That is the highest wisdom, to cast the world behind us, and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.
4. Vanitas igitur est divitias perituras quærere, et in illis sperare. Vanitas quoque est honores ambire, et in altum se extollere. Vanitas est carnis desideria sequi, et illud desiderare unde postmodum graviter oportet puniri. Vanitas est longam vitam optare, et de bona vita modicum curare. Vanitas est præsentem vitam solum attendere, et quæ futura sunt non prævidere. Vanitas est diligere quod cum omni celeritate transit, et illuc non festinare ubi sempiternum manet gaudium.	4. It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that shall perish. It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to lift up ourselves on high. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last. It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life. It is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter. It is vanity to love that which quickly passeth away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abideth.
5. Stude ergo cor tuum ab amore visibilium abstrahere, et ad invisiblia te transferre.  Nam sequentes suam sensualitatem maculant conscientiam, et perdunt Dei gratiam.	5. Be ofttimes mindful of the saying, The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing. Strive, therefore, to turn away thy heart from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen. For they who follow after their own fleshly lusts, defile the conscience, and destroy the grace of God.
Cap. 2. De humili scire sui ipsius.	CHAPTER II Of thinking humbly of oneself
1. Omnis homo naturaliter scire desiderat. Sed scientia sine timore Dei quid importat? Melior est profecto Rusticus humilis, qui Deo fervit, quam superbus Philosophus, qui se neglecto cursum cæli confiderat.  Qui bene se ipsum cognoscit sibi ipsi vilescit, nec laudibus delectatur humanis. Si scirem omnia quæ in mundo sunt, et non essem in charitate, quid me juvaret coram Deo, qui me judicaturus est ex facto?	1. There is naturally in every man a desire to know, but what profiteth knowledge without the fear of God? Better of a surety is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself. He who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither regardeth he the praises of men. If I knew all the things that are in the world, and were not in charity, what should it help me before God, who is to judge me according to my deeds?
2. Quiesce a nimio discendi desiderio, quia ibi magna incitatur distractio et deceptio. Scientes volunt libenter docti videri et sapientes dici. Multa sunt quæ scire animæ parum vel nihil prodest. Et valde insipiens est, qui aliquibus magis intendit, quam his quæ saluti suæ deserviunt.  Multa verba non satiant animam, sed bona vita refrigerat mentem, et pura conscientia magnam ad Deum præstat confidentiam.	2. Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for therein is found much distraction and deceit. Those who have knowledge desire to appear learned, and to be called wise. Many things there are to know which profiteth little or nothing to the soul. And foolish out of measure is he who attendeth upon other things rather than those which serve to his soul’s health. Many words satisfy not the soul, but a good life refresheth the mind, and a pure conscience giveth great confidence towards God.
3. Quanto plus et melius scis, tanto gravius judicaberis inde nisi sancte vixeris. Noli ergo extolli de ulla arte vel scientia, sed potius time de data tibi notitia. Si tibi videtur quod multa scias et satis bene intelligas, scito tamen quia sunt multo plura quæ nesci.Noli sapere altum,sed ignorantiam tuam magis fatere. Quid te vis alicui præferre, cum plures doctiores te inveniantur, et magis in lege periti.  Si vis aliquid utiliter scire, et discere, ama nesciri, et pro nihilo reputari.	3. The greater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely shalt thou be judged, unless thou hast lived holily. Therefore be not lifted up by any skill or knowledge that thou hast; but rather fear concerning the knowledge which is given to thee. If it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things, and understandest them well, know also that there are many more things which thou knowest not. Be not high-minded, but rather confess thine ignorance. Why desirest thou to lift thyself above another, when there are found many more learned and more skilled in the Scripture than thou? If thou wilt know and learn anything with profit, love to be thyself unknown and to be counted for nothing.
4. Hæc est altissima et utilissima lectio, sui ipius vera cognitio, et despectio. De se ipso nihil tenere, et de aliis semper bene et alte sentire magna sapientia est, et perfectio. Si videres aliquem aperte peccare, vel aliqua gravia perpetrare, non deberes te meliorem exstimare, quia nescis quamdiu possis in bono stare.  Omnes fragiles sumus, sed tu neminem fragiliorem te ipso tenebis.	4. That is the highest and most profitable lesson, when a man truly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself. To account nothing of one’s self, and to think always kindly and highly of others, this is great and perfect wisdom. Even shouldest thou see thy neighbor sin openly or grievously, yet thou oughtest not to reckon thyself better than he, for thou knowest not how long thou shalt keep thine integrity. All of us are weak and frail; hold thou no man more frail than thyself.
Cap. 3. De doctrina veritatis.	CHAPTER III Of the knowledge of truth
1. Felix quem Veritas per se ipsam docet, non per figuras et voces transeuntes, sed sicuti se habet. Nostra opinion, et noster sensus sæpe nos fallit, et modicum videt. Quid prodest magna cavillatio de occultis, et obscuris rebus de quibus nec argueur in judicio, quia ignoravimus?  Grandis insipientia quod neglectis utilibus, et necessariis, ultro intendimus curiosis, et damnosis.  Oculos habentes, non videmus.	Happy is the man whom Truth by itself doth teach, not by figures and transient words, but as it is in itself. Our own judgment and feelings often deceive us, and we discern but little of the truth. What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not? Oh, grievous folly, to neglect the things which are profitable and necessary, and to give our minds to things which are curious and hurtful! Having eyes, we see not.
2. Et quid nobis de generibus et speciebus, cui æternum Verbum loquitur a multis opinionibus expeditur. Ex uno Verbo omnia, et unum loquuntur omnia et hoc estPrincipium quod et loquitur nobis.Nemo sine illo intelligit, aut recte judicat. Cuit omnia unam sunt, et qui omnia ad unum trahit, et omnia in uno videt, potest stabilis esse, et in Deo pacificus permanere. O veritas Deus, fac me unum tecum in charitate perpetua. Tædet mihi sæpe multa legere, t audire: in te toum est, quod volo et desidero. Taceant omnes doctores, sileant universæ creaturæ in conspectu tuo, tu mihi loquere solus.	2. And what have we to do with talk about genus and species! He to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from multiplied questionings. From this One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him; and this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto us. No man without Him understandeth or rightly judgeth. The man to whom all things are one, who bringeth all things to one, who seeth all things in one, he is able to remain steadfast of spirit, and at rest in God. O God, who art the Truth, make me one with Thee in everlasting love. It wearieth me oftentimes to read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish for and desire. Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all creation keep silence before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.
3. Quanto magis aliquis unitus, et interius implicatus fuerit, tanto plura et altiora sine labore intelligit quia desuper lumen intelligentiæ accipit. Purus simplex et stabilis in multis operibus non dissipatur, quia omnia ad Dei honorem operatur, et in se otiose ab omni propria exquisitione esse nititur. Quis te magis impedit, et molestat quam tua immortificata cordis affectio? Bonus et devotus homo, opera sua intus prius disponit, quæ foris agere debet, nec illa trahunt ad desideria vitiosæ inclinationis, sed ipse inflectat ea ad arbitrium rectæ intentionis rationis. Quis habet fortius certamen, quam qui nititur vincere se ipsum? Et hoc deberet esse negotium nostrum, vincere scilicet se ipsum, et quotidie se fortiorem ipso fieri, atque in melius proficere.	3. The more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself, the more things and the deeper things he understandeth; and that without labour, because he receiveth the light of understanding from above. The spirit which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not distracted though it hath many works to do, because it doth all things to the honour of God, and striveth to be free from all thoughts of self-seeking. Who is so full of hindrance and annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart? A man who is good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart the works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the desires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the judgment of right reason. Who hath a harder battle to fight than he who striveth for self-mastery? And this should be our endeavour, even to master self, and thus daily to grow stronger than self, and go on unto perfection.
4. Omnis perfectio in hac vita quamdam imperfectionem sibi habet annexam. Et omnis speculatio nostra quadam caligine non caret. Humilis tui cognitio certior via est ad Deum, quam profundæ scientiæ inquisitio. Non est culpanda scientia, aut quælibet rei notitia quæ bona est, in se confiderata, eet a Deo ordinata, sed præferenda est, semper bona conscientia, et vita, quia student magis plures scire quam bene vivere, ideo sæpe errant, et nullum vel modicum fructum ferunt.	4. All perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness. A lowly knowledge of thyself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man’s learning. Not that learning is to be blamed, nor the taking account of anything that is good; but a good conscience and a holy life is better than all. And because many seek knowledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray, and bear little or no fruit.
5. O, si tantam adhiberent diligentiam ad extirpanda vitia, et virtutes inferendas, sicuti movendi quæstiones, non fierent tanta mala et scandala in populo nec tanta dissolutio in cænobiis. Certe adveniente e judicii, non quæretur a nobis quid legimus, sed quid fecimus; nec quam bene diximus, sed quam religiose visimus. Dic mihi, ubi sunt modo illi omnes Domini, et Magistri quos bene nosti dum adhuc bene viverent, et in studiis florerent? Jam eorum præbendas alii possident, et nescio utrum de eis recogitent. In vita sua aliquid videbantur et modo de illis tacetur.	5. O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain questionings: there had not been so many evil doings and stumbling-blocks among the laity, nor such ill living among houses of religion. Of a surety, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have done; not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived. Tell me, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou knewest well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished in learning? Their stalls are now filled by others, who perhaps never have one thought concerning them. Whilst they lived they seemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them.
6. O quam cito transit gloria mundi. Utinam vita eorum scientiæ concordasset eorum, tunc bene legissent et studuissent. Quam multi pereunt per vanam scientiam in hoc sæculo, qui parum curant de Dei fervitio. Et quia magis diligunt magni esse quam humiles, ideo evanuerunt in cognitationibus suis. Vere magnus est qui in si parvus est et pro nihilo omne culmen honoris ducit. Vere prudens est qui omnia terrenaarbitratur uti stercora ut Christum lucrifaciat.Et vere bene doctus est qui Dei voluntatem facit et suam voluntatem relinquit.	6. Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away! Would that their life and knowledge had agreed together! For then would they have read and inquired unto good purpose. How many perish through empty learning in this world, who care little for serving God. And because they love to be great more than to be humble, therefore they “have become vain in their imaginations.” He only is truly great, who hath great charity. He is truly great who deemeth himself small, and counteth all height of honour as nothing. He is the truly wise man, who counteth all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ. And he is the truly learned man, who doeth the will of God, and forsaketh his own will.
Cap. 4. De prudentia in agendis.	CHAPTER IV Of prudence in action 
1. Non est credendum omni verbo nec instinctui sed caute et longanimiter, res est fecundum Deum ponderanda. Proh dolor sæpe malum facilius quam bonum de alio creditur et dicitur ita infirmi sumus. Sed perfecti viri non facile credunt omni enarrant, quia sciunt humanam fragilitatem imo infirmitatem ad malum proclivem et in verbis fatis labilem.	1. We must not trust every word of others or feeling within ourselves, but cautiously and patiently try the matter, whether it be of God. Unhappily we are so weak that we find it easier to believe and speak evil of others, rather than good. But they that are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer, for they know man’s weakness that it is prone to evil and unstable in words.
2. Magna sapientia est non esse præcipitem in agendis, nec pertinaciter in sensibus stare. Ad hanc etiam non pertinet quibuslibet hominum verbis credere nec audita vel credita mox ad aliorum aures effundere.	2. This is great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubborn in our own opinions. A part of this wisdom also is not to believe every word we hear, nor to tell others all that we hear, even though we believe it. 
3. Cum sapiente et sententioso viro consilium habe, et quære potius a melioribus instrui, quam tuas adinventiones sequi. Bona vita facit hominem sapientem secundum Deum, et expertum in multis. Quanto quis in se humilior fuerit, et Deo subjectior, tanto in omnibus erit sapientior et pacatior.	3. Take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by one better than thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions. A good life maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience in many things. The more humble a man is in himself, and the more obedient towards God, the wiser will he be in all things, and the more shall his soul be at peace. 
Cap. 5. De lectione scripturarum.	CHAPTER V Of the reading of Holy Scriptures
1. Veritas est in Scripturis sanctis quærenda, non eloquenda. Omnis Scriptura sacra eo spiritu debet legi, quo facta est. Quærere debemus potius utilitatem in Scripturis, quam subtilitatem sermonis. Ita libenter devotos et simplices libros legere debemus, sicut altos et profundos. Non te defendat auctoritas Scribentis utrum parvæ vel magnæ litteraturæ fuerit, sed amor puræ veritatis te trahat ad legendum. Non quæras quis hoc dixerit, sed quid dicatur attende.	1. It is Truth which we must look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of words. All Scripture ought to be read in the spirit in which it was written. We must rather seek for what is profitable in Scripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse. Therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple, as well as those which are deep and difficult. And let not the weight of the writer be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be of little or much learning, but let the love of the pure Truth draw thee to read. Ask not, who hath said this or that, but look to what he says.
2. Homines transeunt, sedveritas Domini manet in æternum.Sine personarum acceptione variis modis nobis loquitur Deus. Curiositas nostra sæpe nos impedit in lectione Scripturarum, cum volumus intelligere et discutere ubi simpliciter est transeundum. Si vis profectum haurire lege humiliter, simpliciter, et fideliter nec unquam velis habere nomen scientiæ. Interroga libenter, et audi tacens Sanctorum verba, nec displiceant tibi parabolæ Seniorum sine cause enim non proferuntur.	2. Men pass away, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Without respect of persons God speaketh to us in divers manners. Our own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading of holy writings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should pass simply on. If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read humbly, simply, honestly, and not desiring to win a character for learning. Ask freely, and hear in silence the words of holy men; nor be displeased at the hard sayings of older men than thou, for they are not uttered without cause.
Cap. 6. De inordinatis affectibus.	CHAPTER VI Of inordinate affections
1. Quandocumque homo inordinate aliquid appetit statim in se inquietus sit. Superbus et avarus nunquam quiescunt. Pauper et humilis spiritu in multitudine pacis conversatur. Homo qui necdum in se perfecte mortuus est, cito tentatur et vincitur in parvis et vilibus rebus. Infirmus in spiritu, et quodammodo adhuc carnalis ad sensibilia inclinatus, difficulter potest se a terrenis desideriis ex toto extrahere. Et ideo sæpe habet tristitiam cum se subtrahit. Leviter etiam dedignatur, si quis ei resistit.	1. Whensoever a man desireth aught above measure, immediately he becometh restless. The proud and the avaricious man are never at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the multitude of peace. The man who is not yet wholly dead to self, is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters. It is hard for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part carnal and inclined to the pleasures of sense, to withdraw himself altogether from earthly desires. And therefore, when he withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily angered too if any oppose his will.
2. Si autem profecutus fuerit quod concupiscitur, statim ex reatu conscientiæ gravatur, quia secutus est passionem suam, quæ nihil juvat ad pacem, quam quæsivit. Resistendo igitur passionibus invenitur vera pax cordis non autem serviendo eis. Non est ergo pax in corde hominis carnalis, non in homine in exterioribus dedito, sed in fervido spirituali.	2. But if, on the other hand, he yield to his inclination, immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his conscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in no way attained the peace which he hoped for. For true peace of heart is to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it. And therefore there is no peace in the heart of a man who is carnal, nor in him who is given up to the things that are without him, but only in him who is fervent towards God and living the life of the Spirit.
Cap. 7. De vana spe et elatione fugienda.	CHAPTER VII Of fleeing from vain hope and pride
1. Vanus est qui spem suam ponit in hominibus aut in creaturis. Non pudeat te aliis servire amore Domini nostri Jesu Christi, et pauperem in hoc sæculo videri. Non stes super teipsum, sed in Deo spem tuam constitue. Fac quod in te est, et Deus aderit bonæ voluntati tuæ. Non confidas in tua scientia, vel cujuscumque astutia viventi, sed magis in Dei gratia, qui humiles adjuvat, et de se præsumentes humiliat.	1. Vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in any created Thing. Be not ashamed to be the servant of others for the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this life. Rest not upon thyself, but build thy hope in God. Do what lieth in thy power, and God will help thy good intent. Trust not in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that lives, but rather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.
2. Non glorieris in divitiis si adsint, nec in amicis quia potentes sunt, sed in Deo qui omnia præstat, et se ipsum super omnia dare desiderat. Non te extollas de magnitudine vel pulchritudine corporis, quæ modica etiam infirmitate corrumpitur et foedatur. Non placeas tibi ipsi, de humilitate aut ingenio ne displiceas Deo, cujus est totum quidquid boni naturaliter habemus.	2. Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast them, nor in thy friends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all things, and in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself. Be not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away. Be not vain of thy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from whom cometh every good gift which we have.
3. Non te reputes aliis meliorem, ne forte coram Deo deterior habearis qui scit quid est in homine. Non superbias de operibus bonis, quia aliter sunt judicia Dei quam hominum, cui sæpe displicet, quod hominibus placet. Si aliquid boni habueris, crede de aliis meliora, ut humilitatem conserves. Non nocet ut te hominibus supponas, nocet autem plurimum, si vel uni te præponas. Jugis pax cum humili, in corde autem superbi zelus et indignatio frequens.	3. Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou appear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man. Be not proud of thy good works, for God’s judgments are of another sort than the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes displeasing to Him. If thou hast any good, believe that others have more, and so thou mayest preserve thy humility. It is no harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but it is great harm if thou place thyself above even one. Peace is ever with the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is envy and continual wrath.
Cap. 8. De cavenda nimia familiaritate.	CHAPTER VIII Of the danger of too much familiarity
1. Nonomni homini reveles cor tuum,sed cum sapiente, et timente Deum age causam tuam? Cum juvenibus et extraneis rarus esto, cum divitibus noli blandiri, et coram magnatis non libenter appareas. Cum humilibus et simplicibus, cum devotis et morigeratis sociare, et quæ ædificationis sunt pertracta. Non sis familiaris alicui mulieri, sed in communi omnes bonas mulieres Deo commenda. Soli Deo et Angelis ejus opta familiaris esse, et hominum notitiam devita.	1. Open not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise and feareth God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers. Be not a flatterer of the rich; nor willingly seek the society of the great. Let thy company be the humble and the simple, the devout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning things which edify. Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good women alike unto God. Choose for thy companions God and His Angels only, and flee from the notice of men.
2. Charitas est habenda ad omnes, sed familiaritas non expedit. Quandoque accidit ut persona ignota ex bona fama lucescit, tum præsentia oculos intuentium offuscat.  Putamus aliis placere ex convictione nostra, et incipimus magis displicere morum improbitate in nobis considerata.	2. We must love all men, but not make close companions of all. It sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us is highly regarded through good report of him, whose actual person is nevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it. We sometimes think to please others by our intimacy, and forthwith displease them the more by the faultiness of character which they perceive in us.
Cap. 9. De obedientia et subjectione.	CHAPTER IX Of Obedience and Subjection
1. Valde magnum est in obedientia stare, sub Prælato se vivere, et sui juris non esse. Multo tutius est stare in subjectione, quam in prælatura. Multi sunt sub obedientia magis ex necessitate, quam ex charitate, et illi poenam habent, et leviter murmurant, nec libertatem mentis acquirent, nisi ex toto corde propter Deum se subjiciant. Curre hic vel ibi non invenies requiem, nisi in humili subjectione sub Prælati regimine. Imaginatio locorum, et mutatio multos fefellit.	1. It is verily a great thing to live in obedience, to be under authority, and not to be at our own disposal. Far safer is it to live in subjection than in a place of authority. Many are in obedience from necessity rather than from love; these take it amiss, and repine for small cause. Nor will they gain freedom of spirit, unless with all their heart they submit themselves for the love of God. Though thou run hither and thither, thou wilt not find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him who is set over thee. Fancies about places and change of them have deceived many. 
2. Verum est quod unusquisque libenter agit pro sensu suo et inclinatur ad eos magis qui secum sentiunt. Sed si Christus est inter nos, tunc necesse est, ut relinquamus etiam nostrum sentire propter bonum pacis. Quis est ita sapiens, qui omnia plene scire possit? Ergo noli nimis in sensu tuo confidere, sed velis etiam aliorum sensum audire. Si bonum est tuum sentire, et hoc ipsum propter Deum dimittis, et alium sequeris, magis inde proficies.	2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent, and is the more inclined to those who agree with him. But if Christ is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace. Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things? Therefore trust not too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hear the opinions of others. Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another, thou shalt the more profit thereby. 
3. Audivi enim sæpe, securius esse audire, et accipere consilium quam dare. Potest enim contingere ut bonum fit uniuscujusque sentire, sed nolle aliis acquiescere, cum id ratio aut causa postulat, signum est superbiæ aut pertinaciæ.	3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to hearken and to receive counsel than to give it. It may also come to pass that each opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others when reason or occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or wilfulness.
Cap. 10. De superfluitate verborum.	CHAPTER X Of the danger of superfluity of words
1. Caveas tumultum hominum, quantum potes. Multum nam impedit tractatus fæcularium gestorum, etiamsi simplici intentione proferantur. Cito enim inquinamur vanitate et captivamur. Vellem me pluries tacuisse, et inter homines non fuisse. Sed quare tam frequenter loquimur, et invicem fabulamur, cum tamen sine læsione conscientiæ raro ad silentium redimus? Ideo tam frequenter loquimur, quia per multas locutiones ad invicem consolari quærimus, et cor diversis cogitationibus fatigatum optamus relevare, et multum libenter, de his quæ diligimus, seu cupimus, vel quæ nobis sentimus contraria, libet loqui et cogitare.	1. Avoid as far as thou canst the tumult of men; for talk concerning worldly things, though it be innocently undertaken, is a hindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity. Many a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone amongst men. But why do we talk and gossip so continually, seeing that we so rarely resume our silence without some hurt done to our conscience? We like talking so much because we hope by our conversations to gain some mutual comfort, and because we seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts. And we very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or desire, or else of those which we most dislike.
2. Sed proh dolor sæpe inaniter, et frustra. Nam hæc exterior consolatio interioris et divinæ consolationis non modicum detrimentum est. Ideo vigilandum est et orandum ne tempus otiose transeat. Si  loqui licet et expedit, quæ ædificabilia sunt loquere. Malus usus et negligentia profectus nostri multum facit ad incustodiam oris nostri. Juvat tamen non parum ad profectum spiritualem devota spiritualium rerum collatio, maxime ubi pares animo et spiritu in Deo sibi sociantur.	2. But alas! it is often to no purpose and in vain. For this outward consolation is no small hindrance to the inner comfort which cometh from God. Therefore must we watch and pray that time pass not idly away. If it be right and desirable for thee to speak, speak things which are to edification. Evil custom and neglect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of watching over our lips. Nevertheless, devout conversation on spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiritual progress, most of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find their ground of fellowship in God. 
Cap. 11. De pace quærenda, et zelo proficiendi.	CHAPTER XI Of seeking peace of mind and of spiritual progress
1. Multam possumus pacem habere, si volumus nos cum aliorum dictis et factis quæ ad nostram curam non spectant non occupare. Quomodo potest ille in pace die permanere, qui alienis curis se intermiscet, qui occasiones forinsecus quærit, qui parum vel raro se intrinsecur colligit?  Beati simplices, quoniam multam pacem habebunt.	1. We may enjoy abundance of peace if we refrain from busying ourselves with the sayings and doings of others, and things which concern not ourselves. How can he abide long time in peace who occupieth himself with other men’s matters, and with things without himself, and meanwhile payeth little or rare heed to the self within? Blessed are the single-hearted, for they shall have abundance of peace.
2. Quare quidam Sanctorum tam perfecti et contemplativi fuerunt? quia mortificari omnino ab omnibus terrenis desideriis studuerunt, et ideo totis medullis cordis Deo inhærere, atque sibi libere vacare potuerunt. Nos nimium propriis occupamur passionibus, et de transitoriis nimis sollicitamur. Raro nam vitium unum perfecte vincimus, et ad quotidianum profectum non attendimus, ideo frigidi et tepidi remanemus.	2. How came it to pass that many of the Saints were so perfect, so contemplative of Divine things? Because they steadfastly sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires, and so were enabled to cling with their whole heart to God, and be free and at leisure for the thought of Him. We are too much occupied with our own affections, and too anxious about transitory things. Seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault, nor are we zealous for daily growth in grace. And so we remain lukewarm and unspiritual.
3. Si essemus nobismetipsis perfecte intenti, et exterius minime implicati, tunc possemus etiam divina sapere, et de cælesti contemplatione aliquid experiri. Totum et maximum impedimentum est, quia non sumus a passionibus, et concupiscentiis liberi, nec perfectam viam Sanctorum conamur ingredi. Quando etiam modicum adversitatis occurit, nimis cito dijicimur, et ad humanas consolationes convertimur.	3. Were we fully watchful of ourselves, and not bound in spirit to outward things, then might we be wise unto salvation, and make progress in Divine contemplation. Our great and grievous stumbling-block is that, not being freed from our affections and desires, we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the Saints. And when even a little trouble befalleth us, too quickly are we cast down, and fly to the world to give us comfort.
4. Si niteremur sicut viri fortes stare in proelio, profecto auxilium Dominii super nos videremus de cælo. Ipse nam certantes, et de sua gratia sperantes paratus est adjuvare, qui nobis certandi occasiones procurat, ut vincamus. Si tantum in istis exterioribus observantiis profectum religionis ponimus, cito finem habebit devotio nostra. Sed ad radicem securim ponamus, ut purgati a passionibus pacificam mentem possideamus.	4. If we would quit ourselves like men, and strive to stand firm in the battle, then should we see the Lord helping us from Heaven. For He Himself is alway ready to help those who strive and who trust in Him; yea, He provideth for us occasions of striving, to the end that we may win the victory. If we look upon our progress in religion as a progress only in outward observances and forms, our devoutness will soon come to an end. But let us lay the axe to the very root of our life, that, being cleansed from affections, we may possess our souls in peace.
5. Si omni anno unum vitium extirparemus, cito viri perfecti efficeremur. Sed modo contrario sæpe sentimus ut meliores, et puriores in initio conversionis nos fuisse inveniamus quam post multos annos prosessionis. Fervor et profectus noster quotidie deberet crescere, sed nunc pro magno videtur si quis primi fervoris partem possit retinere. Si modicam violentiam faceremus in principio, tunc omnia possemus facere cum levitate et gaudio.	5. If each year should see one fault rooted out from us, we should go quickly on to perfection. But on the contrary, we often feel that we were better and holier in the beginning of our conversion than after many years of profession. Zeal and progress ought to increase day by day; yet now it seemeth a great thing if one is able to retain some portion of his first ardour. If we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the beginning, then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and joy.
6. Grave est assueta dimittere, et gravius est contra propriam voluntatem ire. Sed si non vincis parva et levia, quando superabis difficiliora? Resiste in principio inclinatini tuæ, et malum defere consuetudinem, ne forte paulatim ad majorem te ducat difficultatem. O si adverteres quantum tibi pacem et aliis lætitiam faceres, temetipsum bene habendo, puto quod sollicitior esses ad spiritualem profectum.	6. It is a hard thing to break through a habit, and a yet harder thing to go contrary to our own will. Yet if thou overcome not slight and easy obstacles, how shalt thou overcome greater ones? Withstand thy will at the beginning, and unlearn an evil habit, lest it lead thee little by little into worse difficulties. Oh, if thou knewest what peace to thyself thy holy life should bring to thyself, and what joy to others, methinketh thou wouldst be more zealous for spiritual profit.
Cap. 12. De utilitate adversitatis.	CHAPTER XII Of the uses of adversity
1. Bonum nobis est, quod aliquando habeamus aliquas gravitates et contrarietates, quia sæpe hominem ad cor revocant, quatenus se in exilio esse cognoscat, nec spem suam in aliqua mundi re ponat. Bonum est quod patiamur quandoque contradictiones, et male et imperfecte de nobis sentiatur, etiamsi bene agimus, et intendimus. Ista sæpe juvant ad humilitatem, et a vana gloria nos defendunt. Tunc enim melius interiorem testem Deum quærimus, quando foris vilipendimur ab hominibus, et non bene de nobis creditur.	1. It is good for us that we sometimes have sorrows and adversities, for they often make a man lay to heart that he is only a stranger and sojourner, and may not put his trust in any worldly thing. It is good that we sometimes endure contradictions, and are hardly and unfairly judged, when we do and mean what is good. For these things help us to be humble, and shield us from vain-glory. For then we seek the more earnestly the witness of God, when men speak evil of us falsely, and give us no credit for good.
2. Ideo deberet se homo totaliter firmare, et non esset ei necesse multas consolationes quærere. Quando homo bonæ voluntatis tribulatur vel tentatur aut malis cogitationibus affligitur, tunc Deum magis sibi necessarium intelligit, sine quo nihil omnino se posse testatur. Gemit et orat pro miseriis quas patitur. Tunc tædet eum diutius vivere, mortem optat venire, utpossit dissolvi, et esse cum Christi.Tunc etiam bene advertit securitatem et plenam pacem in mundo non posse stare.	2. Therefore ought a man to rest wholly upon God, so that he needeth not seek much comfort at the hand of men. When a man who feareth God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil thoughts, then he seeth that God is the more necessary unto him, since without God he can do no good thing. Then he is heavy of heart, he groaneth, he crieth out for the very disquietness of his heart. Then he groweth weary of life, and would fain depart and be with Christ. By all this he is taught that in the world there can be no perfect security or fulness of peace.
Cap. 13. De resistendis tentationibus.	CHAPTER XIII Of resisting temptation
1. Quamdiu in mundo vivimus sine tribulatione et tentatione esse non possumus. Unde in Job scriptum est:Tentatio est vita hominis super terram.Ideo unusquisque sollicitus esse deberet circa tentationes suas, et vigilare in orationibus, ne Diabolus inveniret locum decipiendi, qui nunquam dormitat, sedcircuit quærens quem devoret.Nemo tam sanctus et perfectus est, qui non habeat aliquando tentationes, et plene eis carere non possimus.	1. So long as we live in the world, we cannot be without trouble and trial. Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the earth is a trial. And therefore ought each of us to give heed concerning trials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest the devil find occasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but goeth about seeking whom he may devour. No man is so perfect in holiness that he hath never temptations, nor can we ever be wholly free from them.
2. Sunt tamen tentationes hominibus valde utiles, licet molestæ sint et graves, quia in his homo humiliatur, purgatur et eruditur. Omnes Sancti per multas tribulationes et tentationes transierunt et profecerunt, et qui tentationes sustinere nequiverunt, reprobi facti sunt, et defecerunt. Non est aliquis ordo tam sanctus, et locus tam secretus, ubi non sint tentationes et adversitates.	2. Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our profit, even though they be great and hard to bear; for through them we are humbled, purified, instructed. All Saints have passed through much tribulation and temptation, and have profited thereby. And they who endured not temptation became reprobate and fell away. There is no position so sacred, no place so secret, that it is without temptations and adversities.
3. Non est homo securus a tentationibus totaliter, quam diu vixerit, quia in nobis est unde tentamur. Ex quo in concupiscentia nati sumus, una tribulatione vel tentatione recedene alia supervenit, et semper aliquid ad patiendum habemus. Nam bonum felicitatis perdidimus. Multi quærunt tentationes fugere, et gravius incidunt in eas. Per solam fugam non possumus vincere, sed per patientiam et veram humilitatem, omnibus hositbus efficimur fortiores.	3. There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves, in that we are born in concupiscence. One temptation or sorrow passeth, and another cometh; and always we shall have somewhat to suffer, for we have fallen from perfect happiness. Many who seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply into them. By flight alone we cannot overcome, but by endurance and true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies.
4. Qui tantummodo exterius declinat, nec radicem evellit, parum proficiet, imo citius ad eum tentationes redient, et pejus sævient. Paulatim, et per patientiam cum longanimitate Deo juvante melius superabis, quam cum duritia et importunitate propria. Sæpe accipe consilium in tentatione, et cum tentato noli duriter agere, sed consolationes ingere, sicut tibi optares fieri.	4. He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the root, shall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to him the more quickly, and will be the more terrible. Little by little, through patience and long-suffering, thou shalt conquer by the help of God, rather than by violence and thine own strength of will. In the midst of temptation often seek counsel; and deal not hardly with one who is tempted, but comfort and strengthen him as thou wouldest have done unto thyself.
5. Initium omnium malarum tentationum inconstantia animi est, et parva ad Deum confidentia, quia sicut navis sine gubernaculo hinc inde a fluctibus impellitur, ita homo remissus, et suum propositum deferens varie tentatur. Ignis probat ferrum, et tentatio hominem justum. Nescimus sæpe quid possumus, sed tentatio aperit quid sumus. Vigilandum tum præcipue circa initium tentationis, quia tunc facilius hostis vincitur, si ostium mentis nullatenus intrare finitur, sed extra limen statim ut pulsaverit illi obviatur. Unde quidam dixit,Principiis obsta, sero medicina paratur.Nam primo occurrit menti simplex cogitatio, deinde fortis imaginatio, postea delectatio, et motus pravus, et assensio, sicque paulatim hostis malignus ex toto ingreditur, dum illi non resistitur in pricipio. Et quanto diutius ad resistendum quis torpuerit, tanto in se quotidie debilior fit, et hostis contra eum potentior.	5. The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of temper and want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a helm is tossed about by the waves, so is a man who is careless and infirm of purpose tempted, now on this side, now on that. As fire testeth iron, so doth temptation the upright man. Oftentimes we know not what strength we have; but temptation revealeth to us what we are. Nevertheless, we must watch, especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe the more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within the mind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked. Wherefore one saith, Check the beginnings; once thou might’st have cured, But now ’tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured. For first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the strong imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent. And so little by little the enemy entereth in altogether, because he was not resisted at the beginning. And the longer a man delayeth his resistance, the weaker he groweth, and the stronger groweth the enemy against him.
6. Quidam in principio conversionis suæ graviores tentationes patiuntur, quidam in fine, quidam quasi per totam vitam suam male habent. Nonnulli fatis leviter tentantur, secundum divinæ ordinationis sapientiam et æquitatem, quæ statum, et hominum merita pensat, et cuncta ad electorum suorum salutem præordinat.	6. Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the beginning of their conversion, some at the end. Some are sorely tried their whole life long. Some there are who are tempted but lightly, according to the wisdom and justice of the ordering of God, who knoweth the character and circumstances of men, and ordereth all things for the welfare of His elect.
7. Ideo non debemus desperare, cum tentamur, sed eo ferventius Deum exorare, quatenus dignetur in omni tribulatione nostra nos adjuvare, qui utique, secundum dictum S. Pauli,etiam faciet cum tentatione proventum, ut possimus sustinere.Humiliemus ergo animas nostras sub manu Dei in omni tentatione et tribulatione, quia humiles spiritu salvabit, et exultabit.	7. Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the more fervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to help us in all our tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul saith, with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it. Let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God in all temptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt such as are of an humble spirit.
8. In tentationibus et tribulationibus probatur homo quantum profecit, et ibi majus meritum existit, et virtus melius patescit. Nec magnum est, si homo devotus fit, et fervidus, cum gravitatem non sentit, sed si tempore adversitatis patienter se sustinet, spes magni profectus erit. Quidam a magnis tentationibus custodiuntur, et in quotidianis tam sæpe vincuntur, ut humiliati, nunquam de se ipsis in magnis confidant, qui in tam modicis infirmantur.	8. In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue doth the more appear. Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he behave himself patiently in the time of adversity, then is there hope of great progress. Some are kept safe from great temptations, but are overtaken in those which are little and common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to themselves in great things, being weak in small things.
Cap. 14. De temerario judicio vitando.	CHAPTER XIV On avoiding rash judgment
1. Ad te ipsum oculos reflecte et aliorum facta caveas judicare. In judicando alios homo frustra laborat, sæpius errat, et leviter peccat. Se ipsum vero judicando et discutiendo semper fructuose laborat. Sicut nobis res cordi est, sic de ea frequenter judicamus. Nam verum judicium propter privatum amorem faciliter perdimus. Si Deus semper esset pura intentio desiderii nostri, non tam faciliter turbaremur pro resistentia sensus nostri.	1. Look well unto thyself, and beware that thou judge not the doings of others. In judging others a man laboureth in vain; he often erreth, and easily falleth into sin; but in judging and examining himself he always laboureth to good purpose. According as a matter toucheth our fancy, so oftentimes do we judge of it; for easily do we fail of true judgment because of our own personal feeling. If God were always the sole object of our desire, we should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgment of our fancy.
2. Sed semper aliquid ab intra latet, vel etaim ab extra concurrit, quod nos etiam pariter trahit. Multi occulte se ipsos quærunt in rebus, quas agunt, et nesciunt. Videntur etiam in bona pace stare, quum res pro eorum velle fiunt. Propter diversitatem sensuum, et opinionum satis frequenter oriuntur diffensiones inter amicos et cives, inter religiosos et devotos.	2. But often some secret thought lurking within us, or even some outward circumstance, turneth us aside. Many are secretly seeking their own ends in what they do, yet know it not. They seem to live in good peace of mind so long as things go well with them, and according to their desires, but if their desires be frustrated and broken, immediately they are shaken and displeased. Diversity of feelings and opinions very often brings about dissensions between friends, between countrymen, between religious and godly men.
3. Antiqua consuetudo difficulter relinquitur et ultra proprium videre nemo libenter ducitur. Si rationi tuæ magis inniteris vel industriæ, quam virtuti subjectivæ Jesu Christi, raro et trade eris homo illuminatus, quia Deus vult nos sibi perfecte subjicii, et omnem rationem per inflammatum amorem transcendere.	3. Established custom is not easily relinquished, and no man is very easily led to see with the eyes of another. If thou rest more upon thy own reason or experience than upon the power of Jesus Christ, thy light shall come slowly and hardly; for God willeth us to be perfectly subject unto Himself, and all our reason to be exalted by abundant love towards Him.
Cap. 15. De operibus ex charitate factis.	CHAPTER XV Of works of charity
1. Pro nulla re mundi, et pro nullius hominis dilectione aliquod malum est faciendum.  Sed pro utilitate indigentis bonum opus aliquando intermittendum aut quandoque pro meliori mutandum. Hoc nam facto opus bonum non destruitur, sed in melius commutatur. Sine charitate opus externum non prodest quemquam. Quicquid autem ex charitate agitur quantumcumque etiam parvum sit, et despectum totum efficitur fructuosum. Magis si quidem Deus pensat ex quanto quis agit, quam quantum quis facit.	1. For no worldly good whatsoever, and for the love of no man, must anything be done which is evil, but for the help of the suffering a good work must sometimes be postponed, or be changed for a better; for herein a good work is not destroyed, but improved. Without charity no work profiteth, but whatsoever is done in charity, however small and of no reputation it be, bringeth forth good fruit; for God verily considereth what a man is able to do, more than the greatness of what he doth.
2. Multum quis facit, qui multum diligit. Multum facit qui rem bene facit. Bene facit, qui magis communitati, quam suæ voluntati fervit. Sæpe videtur esse charitas, et est magis carnalitas, quia carnalis inclinatio, propria voluntas, spes retributionis, affectus voluntatis raro abesse volunt.	2. He doth much who loveth much. He doth much who doth well. He doth well who ministereth to the public good rather than to his own. Oftentimes that seemeth to be charity which is rather carnality, because it springeth from natural inclination, self-will, hope of repayment, desire of gain. 
3. Qui veram et perfectam charitatem habet, in nulla re se ipsum quærit, sed Dei solummodo gloriam in omnibus fieri desiderat. Nulli etiam invidet, quia nullum privatum gaudium amat, nec in se ipso vult gaudere, sed in Deo super omnia optat bona beatificari. Nemini aliquid boni attribuit, sed totaliter ad Deum refert tota, unde omnia procedunt. In quo finaliter omnes Sancti fruibiliter quiescunt. O qui scintillam haberet veræ charitatis, perfecte omnia terrena sentiret plena vanitatis.	3. He who hath true and perfect charity, in no wise seeketh his own good, but desireth that God alone be altogether glorified. He envieth none, because he longeth for no selfish joy; nor doth he desire to rejoice in himself, but longeth to be blessed in God as the highest good. He ascribeth good to none save to God only, the Fountain whence all good proceedeth, and the End, the Peace, the joy of all Saints. Oh, he who hath but a spark of true charity, hath verily learned that all worldly things are full of vanity. 
Cap. 16. De sufferentia defectuum aliorum.	CHAPTER XVI Of bearing with the faults of others
1. Quæ rarissime homo in se vel in aliis emendare non valet, debet patienter sustinere, donec Deus aliter ordinet. Cogita quod sic forte melius est pro tua probatione et patientia, sine qua non sunt multum ponderanda merita nostra. Debes tamen pro talibus impedimentis supplicare, ut tibi dignetur Deus subvenire, ut possis benigne portare.	1. Those things which a man cannot amend in himself or in others, he ought patiently to bear, until God shall otherwise ordain. Bethink thee that perhaps it is better for thy trial and patience, without which our merits are but little worth. Nevertheless thou oughtest, when thou findeth such impediments, to beseech God that He would vouchsafe to sustain thee, that thou be able to bear them with a good will.
2. Si quis semel vel bis admonitus non acquiescit, noli cum eo contendere, sed totum Deo committe, ut fiat voluntas sua, et honor in omnibus servis suis, qui scit bene, malum in bonum convertere. Stude patiens esse in tolerando aliorum defectus, et qualescumque infirmitates, quia et tu multa habes, quæ ab aliis oportet tolerari. Si non potes te talem facere qualem vis, quomodo poteris alium habere ad beneplacitum tuum? Libenter videmus alios perfectos, sed tamen proprios non emendamus defectus.	2. If one who is once or twice admonished refuse to hearken, strive not with him, but commit all to God, that His will may be done and His honour be shown in His servants, for He knoweth well how to convert the evil unto good. Endeavour to be patient in bearing with other men’s faults and infirmities whatsoever they be, for thou thyself also hast many things which have need to be borne with by others. If thou canst not make thine own self what thou desireth, how shalt thou be able to fashion another to thine own liking. We are ready to see others made perfect, and yet we do not amend our own shortcomings.
3. Volumus quod alii districte corrigantur, et nos ipsi corrigi nolumus, aut negari quod petimus. Alios restringi per statuta volumus, et ipsi nullatenus patimur amplius cohiberi. Sic ergo patet, quam raro proximum, sicut nos ipsos pensamus. Si omnes essent perfecti quid tunc haberemus ab aliis pro Deo pati?	3. We will that others be straitly corrected, but we will not be corrected ourselves. The freedom of others displeaseth us, but we are dissatisfied that our own wishes shall be denied us. We desire rules to be made restraining others, but by no means will we suffer ourselves to be restrained. Thus therefore doth it plainly appear how seldom we weigh our neighbour in the same balance with ourselves. If all men were perfect, what then should we have to suffer from others for God?
4. Nunc autem Deus sic ordinavit, ut discamusalter alterius onera portare,quia nemo sine defectu, nemo sine onere, nemo sibi sufficiens, nemo sibi satis sapiens, sed oportet invicem portare, invicem consolari, pariter adjuvare, et ammonere. Quantas autem virtutes quisque fecerit, melius patet occasione adversitatis. Occasiones namque hominem fragilem non faciunt, sed qualis sit, ostendunt.	4. But now hath God thus ordained, that we may learn to bear one another’s burdens, because none is without defect, none without a burden, none sufficient of himself, none wise enough of himself; but it behoveth us to bear with one another, to comfort one another, to help, instruct, admonish one another. How much strength each man hath is best proved by occasions of adversity: for such occasions do not make a man frail, but show of what temper he is.
Cap. 17. De monastica vita.	CHAPTER XVII Of a Religious life
1. Oportet ut discas te ipsum in multis frangere, si vis pacem et concordiam cum aliis tenere. Non est parvum in monasteriis, vel in congregatione habitare, et in illis sine querela conversari, et usque ad mortem fidelis perseverare. Beatus qui ibidem bene visit, et feliciter consummavit. Si vis debite stare et proficere, teneas te tanquam exulem et peregrinum super terram. Oportet te stultum fieri propter Christum, si vis religiosam ducere vitam.	1. It behoveth thee to learn to mortify thyself in many things, if thou wilt live in amity and concord with other men. It is no small thing to dwell in a religious community or congregation, and to live there without complaint, and therein to remain faithful even unto death. Blessed is he who hath lived a good life in such a body, and brought it to a happy end. If thou wilt stand fast and wilt profit as thou oughtest, hold thyself as an exile and a pilgrim upon the earth. Thou wilt have to be counted as a fool for Christ, if thou wilt lead a religious life.
2. Habitus et tonsura modicum faciunt, sed mutatio morum et integra mortificatio passionem verum faciunt religiosum. Qui aliud quærit, quam pure Deum, et animæ suæ salutem, non inveniet nisi tribulationem et dolorem. Non potest etiam diu stare pacificus, qui non nititur esse minimus, et omnibus subjectus. Ad serviendum venisti, non ad regendum, ad paciendum et laborandum scias te vocatum, non ad otiandum, vel fabulandum. Hic ergo probantur homines sicut aurum in fornace. Hic nemo potest stare nisi ex toto corde si voluerit propter Deum humiliare.	2. The clothing and outward appearance are of small account; it is change of character and entire mortification of the affections which make a truly religious man. He who seeketh aught save God and the health of his soul, shall find only tribulation and sorrow. Nor can he stand long in peace, who striveth not to be least of all and servant of all. 3. Thou art called to endure and to labour, not to a life of ease and trifling talk. Here therefore are men tried as gold in the furnace. No man can stand, unless with all his heart he will humble himself for God’s sake. 
Cap. 18. De exemplo Sanctorum Patrum.	CHAPTER XVIII Of the example of the holy fathers 
1. Intuere Sanctorum Patrum vivida exempla, in quibus vera perfectio fulsit, et videbis quam modicum sit, et vere nihil, quod nos agimus. Heu quid est vita nostra, si illis fuerit comparata. Sancti et amici Christi Domino servierunt in fame et siti, in frigore et nuditate, in labore et fatigatine, in vigiliis et jejuniis, in orationibus et sanctis meditationibus, in persecutionibus et opprobriis multis.	1. Consider now the lively examples of the holy fathers, in whom shone forth real perfectness and religion, and thou shalt see how little, even as nothing, is all that we do. Ah! What is our life when compared to theirs? They, saints and friends of Christ as they were, served the Lord in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, in labour and weariness, in watchings and fastings, in prayer and holy meditations, in persecutions and much rebuke.
2. O quam multas, et graves tribulationes passi sunt Apostoli, Martyres et Confessores, Virginies et reliqui omnes, qui Christi vestigia voluerunt sequi. Nam animas suas in hoc mundo oderunt, ut in vitam æternam eas possiderent. O quam strictam et abdicatam vitam sancti Patres in eremo duxerunt, quam longas, et graves tentationes pertulerunt: quam frequenter ab inimico vexati sunt, quam graves, et fervidas orationes Deo obtulerunt, quam rigidas abstinentias peregerunt, quam magnum zelum, et fervorem ad spiritualem profectum habuerunt, quam forte bellum adversus edomationem vitiorum gesserunt, quam puram, et rectam intentionem ad Deum tenuerunt, per diem laborabant, et noctibus orationi diutinæ vacabant: quamquam laborando ab oratione mentali minime cessarent.	2. O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would walk in the footsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in this world that they might keep them unto life eternal. O how strict and retired a life was that of the holy fathers who dwelt in the desert! what long and grievous temptations they did suffer! how often were they assaulted by the enemy! what frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God! what strict fasts did they endure! what fervent zeal and desire after spiritual profit did they manifest! how bravely did they fight that their vices might not gain the mastery! how entirely and steadfastly did they reach after God! By day they laboured, and at night they gave themselves ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even when they were labouring they ceased not from mental prayer.
3. Omne tempus utiliter expendebant, omnis hora ad vacandum Deo brevis videbatur. Et præ magna dulcedine contemplationis, etiam oblivioni tradebatur necessitas corporalis refectionis. Omnibus divitiis, dignitatibus, honoribus, amicis et cognatis renuntiabant. Nihil de mundo habere cupiebant: vix necessaria vitæ sumebant, corpori servire etiam in necessitate dolebant. Pauperes igitur erant rebus terrenis, sed divites valde in gratia, et virtutibus. Foris egebant, sed intus gratia, et consolatione divina reficiebantur.	3. They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed short for retirement with God; and through the great sweetness of contemplation, even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten. They renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen; they desired nothing from the world; they ate the bare necessaries of life; they were unwilling to minister to the body even in necessity. Thus were they poor in earthly things, but rich above measure in grace and virtue. Though poor to the outer eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly benedictions.
4. Mundo erant alieni, sed Deo proximi, ac familiares amici. Sibi ipsis videbantur tanquam nihili, et huic mundo dispecti, sed erant in oculis Dei prætiosi, et delecti. In vera humilitate stabant, in simplici obedientia vivebant, in charitate et patientia ambulabant, et ideo quotidie proficiebant, et magnam apud Deum obtinebant gratiam. Dati sunt in exemplum omnibus Religiosis et plus provocare nos debent ad bene proficiendum, quam tepidorum numerus ad relaxandum.	4. They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as kinsmen and friends. They seemed unto themselves as of no reputation, and in the world’s eyes contemptible; but in the sight of God they were precious and beloved. They stood fast in true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in love and patience; and thus they waxed strong in spirit, and obtained great favour before God. To all religious men they were given as an example, and they ought more to provoke us unto good livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to carelessness of life. 
5. O, quantus fervor omnium Religiosorum in principio suæ sanctæ institutionis fuit; o, quanta devotio orationis, quanta æmulatio virtutis, quam magna disciplina viguit, quanta reverentia et obedientia sub regula in omnibus floruit. Testantur adhuc vestigia derelicta, quod vere viri sancti et perfecti fuerunt, qui tam strenue militantes, mundum suppeditaverunt. Jam magnus utique putatur, si quis transgressor non fuerit, si quis quod accepit cum patientia tolerare potuerit.	5. O how great was the love of all religious persons at the beginning of this sacred institution! O what devoutness of prayer! what rivalry in holiness! what strict discipline was observed! what reverence and obedience under the rule of the master showed they in all things! The traces of them that remain until now testify that they were truly holy and perfect men, who fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot. Now a man is counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he can only endure with patience what he hath undertak
6. O, tepor et negligentia status nostri, quod tam cito declinamus a pristino fervore et jam tædet vivere præ lassitudine et tepore. Utinam in te penitus non dormiret profectus virtutum, qui multa sæpius exempla vidisti devotorum.	6. O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly decline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to live, because of sloth and lukewarmness. May progress in holiness not wholly fall asleep in thee, who many times hast seen so many examples of devout men!
Cap. 19. De exercitiis boni Religiosi.	CHAPTER XIX Of the exercises of a religious man
1. Vita boni Religiosi omnibus virtutibus pollere debet, ut sit talis interius qualis ab hominibus videtur exterius. Et multo plus debet esse intus, quam quod cernitur foris, quia inspector noster est Deus quem summopere revereri debemus ubicumque fuerimus, et tamquam Angeli in conspectu ejus mundi incedere. Omni die renovare debemus propositum nostrum, et ad fervorem nos excitare, quasi hodie primum ad conversionem venissemus ac dicere: Adjuva me Deus in bono proposito et sancto fervitio tuo, et da mihi nunc hodie perfecte incipere, quia nihil est, quod hactenus feci.	1. The life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues, that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men. And verily it should be yet better within than without, for God is a discerner of our heart, Whom we must reverence with all our hearts wheresoever we are, and walk pure in His presence as do the angels. We ought daily to renew our vows, and to kindle our hearts to zeal, as if each day were the first day of our conversion, and to say, “Help me, O God, in my good resolutions, and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may make a good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!”
2. Secundum propositum nostrum est cursus profectus nostri, et multa diligentia opus est bene proficere volenti. Quod si fortiter proponens sæpe deficit, quid faciet ille qui raro aut minus fixe aliquid proponit? Variis tamen modis contingit defertio propositi nostri. Et levis omissio exercitiorum vix sine aliquo dispendio transit. Justorum propositum in gratia potius Dei, quam in propria patientia pendet. In quo et semper confidunt quidquid arripiunt. Nam homo proponit, sed Deus disponit,nec est in homine via ejus.	2. According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress, and much diligence is needful for him who would make good progress. For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly? But manifold causes bring about abandonment of our resolution, yet a trivial omission of holy exercises can hardly be made without some loss to us. The resolution of the righteous dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own wisdom; for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in hand. For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a man is not in himself.
3. Si pietatis causa, aut fraternæ utilitatis proposito, quandoque consuetum omittitur exercitium, facile postea poterit recuperari. Si autem tædio animi, vel negligentia faciliter relinquitur, satis culpabile est et nocivum sentitur. Conemur quantum possumus, adhuc leviter deficiemus in multis. Semper tamen aliquid certi proponendum est, et proponenda sunt illa præcipue quæ amplius nos impediunt. Exteriora nostra et interiora pariter nobis scrutanda sunt, et ordinanda, quia utraque expediunt ad proprium profectum.	3. If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some act of piety, or of some brotherly kindness, it can easily be taken up afterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or slothfulness, then is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt. Strive as earnestly as we may, we shall still fall short in many things. Always should some distinct resolution be made by us; and, most of all, we must strive against those sins which most easily beset us. Both our outer and inner life should be straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to do with our progress.
4. Si non continue te vales colligere, saltem interdum, et ad minus semel in die, mane videlicet aut vespere. Mane propone, vespere discute mores tuos, qualis hodie fuisti in verbo, opere et cogitatione, quia in his forsan Deum sæpius offendisti ex proximum. Accinge te sicut vir fortis contra diabolicas nequitias, fræna gulam et omnem carnis inclinatinem facilius frænabis. Numquam sis ex toto otiosus, sed aut legens, aut scribens, aut orans, aut meditans, aut aliquid utilitatis pro communi laborans. Corporalia tamen exercitia discrete sunt agenda, nec omnibus æqualiter assumenda.	4. If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at certain seasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at morning. In the morning make thy resolves, and in the evening inquire into thy life, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed, and thought; for in these ways thou hast often perchance offended God and thy neighbour. Gird up thy lions like a man against the assaults of the devil; bridle thine appetite, and thou wilt soon be able to bridle every inclination of the flesh. Be thou never without something to do; be reading, or writing, or praying, or meditating, or doing something that is useful to the community. Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with discretion, nor are they to be used by all alike.
5. Quæ communia non sunt, non sunt foris ostendenda, nam in secreto tutius exercentur privata. Cavendum tamen ne piger sis ad communia, et ad singularia promptior. Sed expletis integre et fideliter debitis, et injunctis, si jam ultra tempus vacat, redde te tibi, prout tua devotio desiderat. Non possunt omnes habere exercitium unum, sed aliud isti, aliud illi magis deservit, et pro temporis congruentia diversa placent exercitia, quia alia in festis, alia in feriatis magis sapiunt diebus, aliis indigemus tempore tentationis, et aliis tempore pacis et quietis. Alia, cum tristamur, libet cogitare, et alia, cum læti in Domino fuerimus.	5. The duties which are not common to all must not be done openly, but are safest carried on in secret. But take heed that thou be not careless in the common duties, and more devout in the secret; but faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and commands which lie upon thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still leisure, give thyself to thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee. All cannot have one exercise, but one suiteth better to this man and another to that. Even for the diversity of season different exercises are needed, some suit better for feasts, some for fasts. We need one kind in time of temptations and others in time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times of sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord.
6. Circa principalia festa renovanda sunt bona exercitia, et Sanctorum suffragia ferventius imploranda. De festo in festum proponere debemus quasi tunc de sæculo migraturi, et ad æternum festum perventuri. Ideoque sollicite nos præparare debemus in devotis temporibus, et devotius conversari, atque omnem observantiam strictius custodire, tanquam in brevi laboris nostri præmium a Deo percepturi.	6. When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises should be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently besought. We ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to another, as if each were the period of our departure from this world, and of entering into the eternal feast. So ought we to prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn seasons, and the more solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch upon each holy observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward of our labours at the hand of God.
7. Et si dilatum fuerit, credamus nos minus bene paratos, atque indignos tantæ gloriæ, quæ revelabitur in nobis tempore præfinito et studeamus nos melius ad exitum præparare.Beatus servusait Evangelista Lucas,quem, cum venerit Dominus, invenerit vigilantem. Amen dico vobis, super omnia bona sua constituet eum.	7. And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet ill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be revealed in us at the appointed season; and let us study to prepare ourselves the better for our end. Blessed is that servant, as the Evangelist Luke hath it, whom, when the Lord cometh He shall find watching. Verily I say unto you He will make him ruler over all that He hath.
Cap. 20. De amore solitudinis et silentii.	CHAPTER XX Of the love of solitude and silence
1. Quære aptum tempus vacandi tibi, de beneficiis Dei frequenter cogita. Relinque curiosa, tales potius perlege materias, quæ compunctionem magis præstent quam occupationem. Si te subtraxeris a superfluis locutionibus et curiosis circuitionibus nec non a novitatibus et remoribus audiendis, invenies tempus sufficiens et aptum bonis meditationibus insistendis. Maximi Sanctorum humana consortia ubi poterant vitabant et Deo in secreto vivere eligebant.	1. Seek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of the mercies of God to thee. Leave curious questions. Study such matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement. If thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings about, as well as from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy time sufficient and apt for good meditation. The greatest saints used to avoid as far as they could the company of men, and chose to live in secret with God.
2. Dixit quidam:Quoties inter homines fui, minor homo redii.Hoc sæpius experimur, quando diu confabulamur. Facilius est enim tacere quam in verbo non excedere. Facilius est domi latere quam foris se posse sufficienter custodire. Qui igitur intendit ad interiora et spiritualia pervenire, oportet eum cum Jesu a turba declinare. Nemo secure apparet nisi qui libenter latet. Nemo secure præcipit nisi qui obedire didicit. Nemo secure gaudet nisi qui testimonium bonæ conscienitæ habet.	2. One hath said, “As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I returned less a man.” This is what we often experience when we have been long time in conversation. For it is easier to be altogether silent than it is not to exceed in word. It is easier to remain hidden at home than to keep sufficient guard upon thyself out of doors. He, therefore, that seeketh to reach that which is hidden and spiritual, must go with Jesus “apart from the multitude.” No man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to rest at home. No man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace. No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject. No man safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey.
3. Semper tamen Sanctorum securitas plena timoris Dei extitit. Nec eo minus solliciti et humiles in se fuerunt, quia magnis virtutibus et gratia emicuerunt. Pravorum autem securitas ex superbia et præsumptione oritur et in fine in desperationem sui vertitur. Nunquam promittas tibi securitatem in hac vita, quamvis bonus videaris Coenobita, aut bonus Eremita.	3. No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a good conscience within himself. The boldness of the Saints was always full of the fear of God. Nor were they the less earnest and humble in themselves, because they shone forth with great virtues and grace. But the boldness of wicked men springeth from pride and presumption, and at the last turneth to their own confusion. Never promise thyself security in this life, howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest.
4. Sæpe meliores in existimatione hominum magis periclitati sunt propter nimiam suam confidentiam. Unde multum utilius est, ut non penitus tentationibus careant, sed sæpius impugnentur ne nimium securi sint, ne forte in superbiam eleventur, ne etiam ad exteriores consolationes licentius declinent. O, qui nunquam transitoriam lætitiam quæreret, qui nunquam cum mundo se occuparet, quam bonam conscientiam servaret. O, qui omnem vanam sollicitudinem amputaret, et duntaxat salutaria ac divina cogitaret, et totam spem suam in Domino constitueret, quam magnam pacem et quietem possideret.	4. Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the more grievously because of their over great confidence. Wherefore it is very profitable unto many that they should not be without inward temptation, but should be frequently assaulted, lest they be over confident, lest they be indeed lifted up into pride, or else lean too freely upon the consolations of the world. O how good a conscience should that man keep, who never sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled with the world! O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and divine things, and build his whole hope upon God! 
5. Nemo dignus est cælesti consolatione, nisi diligenter se exercuerit in sancta compunctione. Si vis corde tenus compungi, intra cubiculum tuum, et exclude tumultus mundi. Sicut scriptum est,In cubilibus vestris compungimini.In cella invenies, quod de foris sæpius amittes. Cella continuata dulcescit et male custodita tædium generat. Si in principio conversationis tuæ bene eam incolueris, et custodieris, erit postea tibi amica dilecta, et gratissimum solatium.	5. No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath diligently exercised himself in holy compunction. If thou wilt feel compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and shut out the tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with your own heart in your own chamber and be still.In retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad. Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet, but if thou keep not in it, begetteth weariness. If in the beginning of thy conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well, it shall afterwards be to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant solace.
6. In silentio et quiete proficit anima devota, et discit abscondita Scripturarum. Ibi invenit fluenta lacrymarum, quibus singulis noctibus se lavet et mundet, ut Conditori suo tanto familiarior fiat, quanto longius ab omni sæculari tumultu degit. Qui ergo se substrahit a notis et amicis, approximabit illi Deus cum Angelis sanctis. Melius est latere et sui curam agere, quam se neglecto signa facere. Laudabile est homini religioso raro foras ire, fugere videri et nolle homines videre.	6. In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and learneth the hidden things of the Scriptures. Therein findeth she a fountain of tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each night, that she may grow the more dear to her Maker as she dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction. To him who withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and friends God with his holy angels will draw nigh. It is better to be unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders. It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad, to fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men.
7. Quid vis videre, quod non licet habere?Transit mundus, et concupiscentia ejus.Trahunt desideria sensualitatis ad spatiandum. Sed cum hora transierit, quid nisi gravitatem conscientiæ, et cordis dispersionem portat? Lætus exitus tristem sæpe reditum parit et læta vigilia serotina triste mane facit. Sic omne carnale gaudium blande intrat, sed in fine mordet et perimit.	7. Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have? The world passeth away and the lust thereof. The desires of sensuality draw thee abroad, but when an hour is past, what dost thou bring home, but a weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart? A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning? So doth all carnal joy begin pleasantly, but in the end it gnaweth away and destroyeth. What canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at home? Behold the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out of these are all things made.
8. Quid potes videre alicubi, quod die potest sub solem permanere. Credis te forsitan satiari, sed non poteris pertingere. Si cuncta videres præsentia, quid esset, nisi visio vana? Leva oculos tuos ad Deum in excelsis, et ora pro peccatis tuis, et negligentiis. Dimitte vana vanis, tu autem intende illis, quæ tibi præcepit Deus. Claude super te ostium tuum, et voca ad te Jesum dilectum tuum. Mane cum eo in cella, quia non invenies alibi tantam pacem. Si non exisses nec quidquam de rumoribus audisses, melius in bona pace permansisses. Ex quo nova delectaris aliquando audire, oportet te exinde turbationem cordis tolerare.	8. What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the sun? Thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but thou wilt never be able to attain unto this. If thou shouldest see all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain vision? Lift up thine eyes to God on high, and pray that thy sins and negligences may be forgiven. Leave vain things to vain men, and mind thou the things which God hath commanded thee. Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself Jesus thy beloved. Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not elsewhere find so great peace. If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace. But because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou must therefore suffer trouble of heart.
Cap. 21. De compunctione cordis.	CHAPTER XXI Of compunction of heart
1. Si vis aliquid proficere, conserva te in timore Dei et noli esse nimis liber. Sed sub disciplina cohibe omnes sensus tuos, nec ineptæ te tradas lætitiæ, da te ad cordis compunctionem, et invenies devotionem; compunctio multa bona aperit, quæ dissolutio cito perdere consuevit. Mirum est, quod homo possit unquam perfecte lætari in hac vita, qui suum exilium, et tam multa pericula animæ suæ considerat, et pensat.	1. If thou wilt make any progress keep thyself in the fear of God, and long not to be too free, but restrain all thy senses under discipline and give not thyself up to senseless mirth. Give thyself to compunction of heart and thou shalt find devotion. Compunction openeth the way for many good things, which dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose. It is wonderful that any man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who considereth and weigheth his banishment, and the manifold dangers which beset his soul.
2. Propter levitatem cordis et negligentiam defectuum nosrorum non senstimus animæ nostræ dolores, sed sæpe vane reddimus verba, quandomerito flere deberemus. Non est vera libertas, nec bona conscientia, nisi in timore Dei. Felix qui abjicere potest omne impedimentum distractionis, et ad unionem se redigere sanctæ compunctionis. Felix qui a se abdicat quidquid suam conscientiam maculare potest, vel gravare. Certa viriliter. Consuetudo consuetudine vincitur. Si tu scis homies dimittere, ipsi bene dimittent te, tua facta facere.	2. Through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we feel not the sorrows of our soul, but often vainly laugh when we have good cause to weep. There is no true liberty nor real joy, save in the fear of God with a good conscience. Happy is he who can cast away every cause of distraction and bring himself to the one purpose of holy compunction. Happy is he who putteth away from him whatsoever may stain or burden his conscience. Strive manfully; custom is overcome by custom. If thou knowest how to let men alone, they will gladly let thee alone to do thine own works.
3. Non attrahas tibi res aliorum, nec te implices causis majorum. Habeas semper oculum super te primum, et admoneas te ipsum specialiter, præ omnibus tibi dilectis. Si non habes favorem hominum noli exinde tristari, sed hoc tibi sit grave quia non habes te satis bene et circumspecte, sicut deceret servum Dei et devotum Religiosum conversari. Utilius est sæpe et securius, quod homo non habeat multas consolationes in hac vita secudum carnem, præcipue tamen, quod divinas non habemus, aut rarius sentimus nos devotos; in culpa sumus, quia compunctionem non quærimus cordis, ac vanas et extrinsecas non abjicimus.	3. Busy not thyself with the affairs of others, nor entangle thyself with the business of great men. Keep always thine eye upon thyself first of all, and give advice to thyself specially before all thy dearest friends. If thou hast not the favour of men, be not thereby cast down, but let thy concern be that thou holdest not thyself so well and circumspectly, as becometh a servant of God and a devout monk. It is often better and safer for a man not to have many comforts in this life, especially those which concern the flesh. But that we lack divine comforts or feel them rarely is to our own blame, because we seek not compunction of heart, nor utterly cast away those comforts which are vain and worldly.
4. Cognosce te indignum divina consolatione, sed magis dignum multa tribulatione. Quando homo perfecte est compunctus, tunc gravis et amarus est ei totus mundus. Bonus homo sufficientem invenit materiam dolendi et flendi: sive enim considerat se, sive de proximo pensat; scit quia nemo sine tribulatione hic vivit; et quanto strictius sese considerat, tanto amplius dolet. Materiæ justi doloris, et internæ compunctionis sunt peccata, et vitia nostra, quibus ita involuti jacemus, ut raro cælistia contemplari valeamus.	4. Know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation, and worthy rather of much tribulation. When a man hath perfect compunction, then all the world is burdensome and bitter to him. A good man will find sufficient cause for mourning and weeping; for whether he considereth himself, or pondereth concerning his neighbour, he knoweth that no man liveth here without tribulation, and the more thoroughly he considereth himself, the more thoroughly he grieveth. Grounds for just grief and inward compunction there are in our sins and vices, wherein we lie so entangled that we are but seldom able to contemplate heavenly things.
5. Si frequentius de morte tua, quam de longitudine vitæ tua cogitares, non dubium, quin ferventius te emendares. Si etiam futuras Inferni, sivi Pergatorii, poenas cordialiter perpenderes, credo quod libenter dolorem et laborem sustineres, et nihil rigoris formidares. Sed quia ista ad cor non transeunt, et blandimenta adhuc amamus, ideo frigidi et valde pigri remanemus. Sæpe est inopia spiritus unde tam leviter conqueritur corpus miserum. Ora igitur humiliter ad Dominum ut det tibi compunctionis spiritum; et dic cum Propheta,Ciba me Domine pane lacrymarum et potum da mihi in lacrymis in mensura.	5. If thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy life should be, thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to improve. And if thou didst seriously consider the future pains of hell, I believe thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain and fear not discipline. But because these things reach not the heart, and we still love pleasant things, therefore we remain cold and miserably indifferent.
Cap. 22. De conditione humanæ miseriæ.	CHAPTER XXII On the contemplation of human misery
1. Miser es ubicumque fueris, et quocumque te verteris, nisi ad Deum te convertas. Quid turbaris quia non succedit tibi sicut vis et desideras? Quis est qui habeat omnia secundum suam voluntatem? Nec ego, nec tu, nec aliquis hominum super terram. Nemo est in mundo sine aliqua tribulatione, vel angustia, quivis Rex, vel Papa. Quis est, qui melius habet? Utique qui pro Deo aliquid pati valet.	1. Thou art miserable wheresoever thou art, and whithersoever thou turnest, unless thou turn thee to God. Why art thou disquieted because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and desires? Who is he that hath everything according to his will? Neither I, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth. There is no man in the world free from trouble or anguish, though he were King or Pope. Who is he who hath the happiest lot? Even he who is strong to suffer somewhat for God.
2. Dicunt multi imbecilles et infirmi, Ecce quam bonam vitam ille homo habet, quam dives et quam magnus, quam potens et excelsus. Sed attende ad cælestia bona, et videbis quod omnia ista temporalia nulla sunt, sed magis incerta, et valde gravantia, quia nunquam sine solicitudine, et timore possidentur. Non est hominis felicitas habere temporalia ad abundantiam, et sufficit ei mediocritas. Vere miseria est vivere super terram. Quanto homo voluerit esse spiritualior, tanto præfens vita sit ei amarior, quia sentit melius, videt clarius humanæ corruptionis affectus. Nam comedere, bibere, vigilare, dormire, quiescere laborare et cæteris necessitatibus naturæ subjacere vere magna miseria est, et afflictio homini devoto, qui libenter esset absolutus et liber ab omni peccato.	2. There are many foolish and unstable men who say, “See what a prosperous life that man hath, how rich and how great he is, how powerful, how exalted.” But lift up thine eyes to the good things of heaven, and thou shalt see that all these worldly things are nothing, they are utterly uncertain, yea, they are wearisome, because they are never possessed without care and fear. The happiness of man lieth not in the abundance of temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth him. Our life upon the earth is verily wretchedness. The more a man desireth to be spiritual, the more bitter doth the present life become to him; because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of human corruption. For to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to rest, to labour, and to be subject to the other necessities of nature, is truly a great wretchedness and affliction to a devout man, who would fain be released and free from all sin.
3. Valde enim gravatur interior homo necessitatibus ocrporalibus in hoc mundo. Unde Propheta devote rogat quatenus ab istis liber esse valeat, dicens,De necessitatibus meis erue me, Domine.Sed væ non cognoscentibus suam miseriam et corruptibilem vitam. Nam in tantum quidam hanc amplectuntur, licet etiam vix necessaria laborando aut mendicando habeant, ut si possent hic semper vivere, de regno Dei nihil curarent.	3. For the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of the body in this world. Wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth to be freed from them, saying, Deliver me from my necessities, O Lord.(1) But woe to those who know not their own misery, and yet greater woe to those who love this miserable and corruptible life. For to such a degree do some cling to it (even though by labouring or begging they scarce procure what is necessary for subsistence) that if they might live here always, they would care nothing for the Kingdom of God.
4. O insani, et infideles corde, qui tam profunde in terris jacent, ut nihil nisi carnalia sapiant. Sed miseri adhuc in fine sentient graviter, quam vile, et nihilum erat, quod amaverunt. Sancti autem Dei, et omnes devoti amici Christi non attenderunt, quæ carni placuerunt, nec quæ in hoc tempore floruerunt. Sed tota spes eorum, et intentio ad ætena bona anhelabat. Ferebatur totum desiderium eorum ad mansura et invisibilia, ne amore visibilium traherentur ad infima.	4. Oh foolish and faithless of heart, who lie buried so deep in worldly things, that they relish nothing save the things of the flesh! Miserable ones! they will too sadly find out at the last, how vile and worthless was that which they loved. The saints of God and all loyal friends of Christ held as nothing the things which pleased the flesh, or those which flourished in this life, but their whole hope and affection aspired to the things which are above. Their whole desire was borne upwards to everlasting and invisible things, lest they should be drawn downwards by the love of things visible.
5. Noli frater amittere confidentiam proficiendi ad spiritualia. Adhuc enim habes tempus et horam, quare vis procrastinare propositum tuum? Surge, et in instanti incipe, et dic: Nunc est tempus faciendi, nunc tempus pugnandi est, nunc tempus aptum est emendandi. Quando male habes et tribularis, tunc tempus promerendi. Oportet te transire per ignem et aquam, antequam venia ad refrigerium, nisi tibi vim feceris, vitium non superabis. Quamdiu istud fragile corpus gerimus, sine peccato esse non possumus nec sine tædio et dolore vivere. Libenter haberemus ab omni miseria quietem, sed quia per peccatum perdidimus innocentiam, amisimus etiam veram beatitudinem. Ideo oportet nos tenere patientiam, et Dei exspectare misericordiam,donec transeat iniquitashæc, et mortalitas abforbeatur a vita.	5. Lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things spiritual. There is yet time, the hour is not past. Why wilt thou put off thy resolution? Arise, begin this very moment, and say, “Now is the time to do: now is the time to fight, now is the proper time for amendment.” When thou art ill at ease and troubled, then is the time when thou art nearest unto blessing. Thou must go through fire and water that God may bring thee into a wealthy place. Unless thou put force upon thyself, thou wilt not conquer thy faults. So long as we carry about with us this frail body, we cannot be without sin, we cannot live without weariness and trouble. Gladly would we have rest from all misery; but because through sin we have lost innocence, we have lost also the true happiness. Therefore must we be patient, and wait for the mercy of God, until this tyranny be overpast, and this mortality be swallowed up of life.
6. O quanta fragilitas humana, quæ semper prona est ad vitia. Hodie confiteris peccata tua, et cras iterum perpetras confessa. Nunc proponis cavere, et post horam ita agis, quasi nihil proposuisses. Merito ergo nosmetipsos humiliare possumus, nec unquam aliquid magni de nobis sentire, quia tam fragiles et instabiles sumus. Cito etiam potest perdi per negligentiam, quod multo labore vix tandem acquisitum est per gratiam.	6. O how great is the frailty of man, which is ever prone to evil! To-day thou confessest thy sins, and to-morrow thou committest again the sins thou didst confess. Now dost thou resolve to avoid a fault, and within an hour thou behavest thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all. Good cause have we therefore to humble ourselves, and never to think highly of ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and unstable. And quickly may that be lost by our negligence, which by much labour was hardly attained through grace.
7. Quid fiet de nobis adhuc in fine, qui tepescimus tam mane. Væ nobis si sic volumus declinare ad quietem, quasi jam pax sit et securitas, cum necdum appareat vestigium sanctitatis veræ in nostra conversatione. Bene opus esset quod adhuc institueremus, tanquam boni novitii, ad mores optimos, si forte spes esset de futurea emendatione, et majori spirituali profectu.	7. What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are lukewarm and idle? Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though it were a time of peace and security, while as yet no sign appeareth in our life of true holiness. Rather had we need that we might begin yet afresh, like good novices, to be instructed unto good living, if haply there might be hope of some future amendment and greater spiritual increase.
Cap. 23. De meditatione mortis.	CHAPTER XXIII Of meditation upon death
1. Valde cito erit tecum hoc factum: vide aliter quomodo te habeas. Hodie homo est, et cras non comparet. Cum autem sublatus fuerit ab oculis, etiam cito transit a mente. O hebetudo, et duritia cordis humani, quod solum præsentia meditatur, et futura non magis prævidet. Sic te in omni facto et cogitatu deberes tenere, quasi statim esses moriturus. Si bonam conscientiam haberes, non multum mortem timeres. Melius esset peccata cavere quam mortem fugure. Si hodie non es paratus, quomodo cras eris? Cras est dies incerta, et quid scis si crastinum habebis?	1. Very quickly will there be an end of thee here; take heed therefore how it will be with thee in another world. To-day man is, and to-morrow he will be seen no more. And being removed out of sight, quickly also he is out of mind. O the dulness and hardness of man’s heart, which thinketh only of the present, and looketh not forward to the future. Thou oughtest in every deed and thought so to order thyself, as if thou wert to die this day. If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear death. It were better for thee to watch against sin, than to fly from death. If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt thou be ready to-morrow? To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow?
2. Quid prodest diu vivere, quando parum emendamur? Ha, longa vita non semper emendat, sed sæpe culpam magis auget. Utinam per unam diem bene essemus conversati in hoc mundo. Multi annos computant conversionis, sed sæpe parvus est fructus emendationis. Si formidolosum est mori, forsitan periculosius erit vivere diu. Beatus qui horam mortis suæ semper ante oculos habet, et ad moriendum quotidie se disponit. Si vidisti aliquem mori, cogita quia tu per eandem viam transibis.	2. What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little? Ah! long life doth not always amend, but often the more increaseth guilt. Oh that we might spend a single day in this world as it ought to be spent! Many there are who reckon the years since they were converted, and yet oftentimes how little is the fruit thereof. If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long. Happy is the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and daily prepareth himself to die. If thou hast ever seen one die, consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.
3. Cum mane fuerit, puta te ad vesperum non perventurum. Vespere autem facto, mane non audeas tibi polliceri. Semper ergo paratus esto, et taliter vive, ut nunquam imparatum te mors inveniant. Multi subito improvisi moriuntur. Namhora, qua non putatur, Filius hominis veniet.Quando hora illa extrema venerit, multum aliter sentire incipies de tota vita tua præterita et valde dolebis, quia tam negligens, et remissus fuisti.	3. When it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see the evening, and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the morrow. Always be thou prepared, and so live that death may never find thee unprepared. Many die suddenly and unexpectedly. For at such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh. When that last hour shall come, thou wilt begin to think very differently of thy whole life past, and wilt mourn bitterly that thou hast been so negligent and slothful.
4. Quam felix et prudens qui talis nunc nititur esse in vita, qualis optat inveniri in morte. Dabit namque magnam fiduciam moriendi perfectus contemptus mundi, fervens desiderium in virtutibus proficiendi, amor disciplinæ, labor poenitentiæ, promptitudo, obedientiæ, abnegatio sui, et supportatio cujuslibet adversitatis pro amore Christi. Multa bona potes operari dum sanus es, sed infirmatus nescio quid poteris. Pauci ex infirmitate emendantur; sic et qui multum peregrinantur, raro sanctificantur.	4. Happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he would fain be found in death! For a perfect contempt of the world, a fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of discipline, the painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey, denial of self, submission to any adversity for love of Christ; these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy death. Whilst thou art in health thou hast many opportunities of good works; but when thou art in sickness I know not how much thou wilt be able to do. Few are made better by infirmity: even as they who wander much abroad seldom become holy.
5. Noli confidere super amicos et proximos, nec in futuris salutem tuam differas, quia citius obliviscentur tui homines, quam existimas. Melius est nunc tempestive providere et aliquid boni præmittere, quam super aliorum auxilio sperare. Si non es pro te ipso sollicitus modo, quis erit sollicitus pro te in futuro. Nunc tempus est valde prætiosum, sed proh dolor, quod hoc inutilius expendis, in quo promereri vales, unde æternaliter vivas. Veniet quando unam diem seu horam pro emendatione desiderabis, et nescio, an impetrabis.	5. Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of thy salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than thou thinkest. It is better for thee now to provide in time, and to send some good before thee, than to trust to the help of others. If thou art not anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest thou, will be anxious for thee afterwards? Now the time is most precious. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. But alas! that thou spendest not well this time, wherein thou mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee everlastingly. The hour will come when thou shalt desire one day, yea, one hour, for amendment of life, and I know not whether thou shalt obtain.
6. Eia, charissime, de quanto periculo te poteris liberare, de quam magno timore eripere, si modo semper timoratus fueris, et de morte suspectus! Stude nunc taliter vivere, ut in hora moris valeas potius gaudere, quam timere. Disce nunc mori mundo, ut tunc incipias vivere cum Christo. Disce nunc omnia contemnere, ut tunc possis libere ad Christum pergere. Castiga nunc corpus tuum per poenitentiam, ut tunc valeas certam habere confidentiam.	6. Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free thyself, from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live in fear, and in expectation of death! Strive now to live in such wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than fear. Learn now to die to the world, so shalt thou begin to live with Christ. Learn now to contemn all earthly things, and then mayest thou freely go unto Christ. Keep under thy body by penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure confidence.
7. Ha stulte, quid cogitas te diu victurum, cum nullum diem habeas securum? Quam multi decepti sunt et insperati de corpore extracti! Quoties audisti a dicentibus, quia ille gladio cecidit, ille submersus est, ille ab alto ruens cervicem fregit, ille manducando obriguit, ille ludendo finem fecit, alius igne, alius ferro, alius peste, alius latrocinio interiit: et sic omnium finis mors est, et vita hominum tanquam umbra cito pertransit.	7. Ah, foolish one! why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long, when thou art not sure of a single day? How many have been deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body! How many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword, another was drowned, another falling from on high broke his neck, another died at the table, another whilst at play! One died by fire, another by the sword, another by the pestilence, another by the robber. Thus cometh death to all, and the life of men swiftly passeth away like a shadow.
8. Quis memorabitur tui post mortem, et qui orabit pro te? Age, age nunc charissime quidquid pro te agere potes, quia nescis quando morieris. Nescis etiam, quid tibi post mortem sequatur. Dum tempus habes, congrega divitias immortales. Præter salutem tuam nihil cogites. Solum quæ Dei sunt, cures.Fac nunc tibi amicosvenerando Sanctos, et actus imitando,ut cum defeceris in hac vita, illi te recipiant in æterna tabernacula.	8. Who will remember thee after thy death? And who will entreat for thee? Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou canst. For thou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall happen unto thee after death. While thou hast time, lay up for thyself undying riches. Think of nought but of thy salvation; care only for the things of God. Make to thyself friends, by venerating the saints of God and walking in their steps, that when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting habitations.
9. Serva te tanquam peregrinum et hospitem super terram, ad quem nihil spectat de mundi negociis. Serva cor liberum, et ad Deum sursum erectum, quia non habes hic manentem civitatem. Illuc gemitus et preces quotidianas cum lacrymis dirige, ut spiritus tuus mereatur post mortem ad Dominum feliciter transire.	9. Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to whom the things of the world appertain not. Keep thine heart free, and lifted up towards God, for here have we no continuing city. To Him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears, that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death unto its Lord. 
Cap. 24. De judicio et poenis peccatorum.	CHAPTER XXIV Of the judgment and punishment of the wicked
1. In omnibus rebus respice finem, et qualiter ante districtum judicem stabis, cui nihil est occultum, qui muneribus non placatur, nec escusationes recipit, sed quod justum est, judicabit. O miserrime et insipiens, quid respondebis Deo, omniamala tua scienti, qui interdum times vultum hominis irati? Ut quid non prævides tibi in judicii die? Quando nemo poterit per alium excusari vel defendi, sed unusquisque sufficiens onus suum portabit sisi ipsi. Nunc labor tuus est fructuosus, fletus acceptabilies, gemitus exaudibilis, dolor satisfactorius et purgativus.	1. In all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not bribed with gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge righteous judgment. O most miserable and foolish sinner, who art sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man, what wilt thou answer to God, who knoweth all thy misdeeds? Why dost thou not provide for thyself against the day of judgment, when no man shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another, but each one shall bear his burden himself alone? Now doth thy labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to thy soul.
2. Habet magnum et salubre purgatorium homo patiens, qui suscipiens injurias, plus dolet de alterius malitia, quam de sua injuria, qui pro contrariantibus sibi libenter orat, et ex corde culpas indulget; qui veniam ab aliis petere non retardat, qui facilius miseretur quam irascitur, qui sibi ipsi violentiam frequenter facit, et carnem suam omnino spiritui subjugare conatur. Melius est modo purgare peccata, et vitia resecare, quam in futuro purganda reservare. Vere nos ipsos decipimus per inordinatum amorem, quem ad carnem habemus.	2. Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of purifying his soul. When suffering injuries he grieveth more for the other’s malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth heartily for those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them from his heart; when he is not slow to ask pardon from others; when he is swifter to pity than to anger; when he frequently denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to the spirit. Better is it now to purify the soul from sin, than to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter. Truly we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards the flesh.
3. Quid aliud ille ignis devorat, nisi peccata tua? Quanto amplius nunc tibi ipsi parcis, et carnem sequeris, postea lues tanto durius, et majorem materiam comburendi reservas. In quibus homo peccavit, in illis gravius punietur. Ibi acidiosi ardentibus stimulis purgentur, et gulosi ingenti fame ac siti cruciabuntur. Ibi luxuriosi et voluptatum amatores ardenti pice et foetido sulphure perfundentur. Et sicut furiosi canes, præ dolore invidiosi ululabunt.	3. What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins? The more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy shall thy punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up for the burning. For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he be the more heavily punished. There shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning goads, and the gluttons be tormented with intolerable hunger and thirst. There shall the luxurious and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for very grief.
4. Nullum vitium erit, quod suum proprium cruciatum non habeat. Ibi superbi omni confusione replebuntur, et avari miserrima egestate arctabuntur.  Ibi erit una hora gravior in poena, quam hic centum anni in amarissima poenitentia. Ibi nulla requies, nulla consolatio damnatis. Hic tamen interdum cessatur a laboribus atque amicorum fruitur solatiis. Esto modo sollicitus, et dolens pro peccatis tuis, ut in die judicii sis securus propetenus cum beatis.Tuncenimjusti stabunt in magna constantia adversus eos, qui se angustiaveruntet depresserunt. Tunc stabit ad judicandum qui modo se subjicit humiliter judiciis hominum. Tunc magnam fiduciam pauper et humlis habebit, et pavebit undique superbus.	4. No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter confusion, and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable poverty. An hour’s pain there shall be more grievous than a hundred years here of the bitterest penitence. No quiet shall be there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends. Be thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed. For then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his labours. Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men. Then shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the proud is taken with fear on every side.
5. Tunc videbitur sapiens in hoc mundo fuisse, qui pro Christo didicit stultus esse et despectus. Tunc placebit omnis tribulatio patienter perpessaet omnis iniquitas oppilabit os suum.Tunc gaudebit omnis devotus et merebit omnis religiosus. Tunc plus exultabit caro afflicta, quam si semper in deliciis fuisset nutrita. Tunc splendebit habitus vilis, et obtenebrescet vestis subtilis. Tunc plus laudabitur pauperculum domicilium, quam deauratum palatium. Tunc plus juvabit constans pacientia, quam omnis mundi potentia. Tunc amplius exaltabitur simplex obedientia, quam omnis sæcularis astutia.	5. Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world who learned to be a fool and despised for Christ. Then shall all tribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the ungodly shall be stopped. Then shall every godly man rejoice, and every profane man shall mourn. Then the afflicted flesh shall more rejoice than if it had been alway nourished in delights. Then the humble garment shall put on beauty, and the precious robe shall hide itself as vile. Then the little poor cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace. Then enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the world. Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than all worldly wisdom.
6. Tunc plus lætificabit pura et simplex conscientia et bona quam docta philosophia. Tunc plus ponderabit contemptus divitiarum, quam totus thesaurus terrigenarum. Tunc magis consolaberis super devota oratione, quam super delicata comestione. Tunc potius gaudebis de fervato silentio, quam de longa fabulatione. Tunc plus valebunt sancta sancta opera, quam multa pulchra verba. Tunc  plus valebit stricta vita et ardus poenitntia, quam omnis delectatio terrena. Disce nunc in modico pati, ut tunc a gravioribus valeas liberari. Hic primo proba quid possis pati postea. Si nunc tam parum non vales sustinere, quomodo poteris æterna tormenta sufferre? Si modo modica passio te tam impatientem efficit, tunc gehenna quid facietur? Ecce vere non potes modo duo gaudia habere, delectari hic in mundo, es postea regnare cum Christo.	6. Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than learned philosophy. Then contempt of riches shall have more weight than all the treasure of the children of this world. Then shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in having fared sumptuously. Then thou wilt rather rejoice in having kept silence than in having made long speech. Then holy deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words. Then a strict life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all earthly delight. Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings. Prove first here, what thou art able to endure hereafter. If now thou art able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal torments? If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient, what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not able to have two Paradises, to take thy fill or delight here in this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.
7. Si usque in hodiernum diem semper in honoribus et voluptatibus vixisses, quid totum tibi profuisset, si jam in instanti mori contingeret? Omnia ergo vanitas, præter amare Deum, et illi foli servire. Qui enim Deum ex toto corde amat, nec mortem, nec supplicium, nec judcium, nec infernum metuit, quia perfectus amor securum ad Deum accessum facit. Quem adhuc peccare delectat, non mirum, si mortem, judicium timeat. Bonum tamen est ut, si necdum amor a malo te revocat, saltem timor gehenæ te coerceat. Qui vero timorem Dei postponit, diu stare in bono non valebit, sed diaboli laqueos citius incurret.	7. If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to thee in an instant? All therefore is vanity, save to love God and to serve Him only. For he who loveth God with all his heart feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell, because perfect love giveth sure access to God. But he who still delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and judgment. Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should hold thee back. But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of the devil.
Cap. 25. De ferventi emendatione totius vitæ.	CHAPTER XXV Of the zealous amendment of our whole life
1. Esto vigilans et diligens in Dei fervitio, et cogita frequenter ad quid venisti, et cur sæculum reliquisti. Nonne ut Deo viveres, et spiritualis fieres? Igitur ad profectum ferveas, quia mercedem laborum tuorum in brevi recipies. Nec erit tunc amplius timor aut dolor in finibus tuis. Modicum nunc laborabis, et magnam requiem, imo perpetuam lætitiam, invenies. Si tu permanseris fidelis et fervidus in agendo, Deus procul dubio erit fidelis, et locuples in retribuendo. Spem bonam retinere debes, quod ad palmam pervenies, sed securitatem capere non oportet ne torpeas, aut elatus fias.	1. Be thou watchful and diligent in God’s service, and bethink thee often why thou hast renounced the world. Was it not that thou mightest live to God and become a spiritual man? Be zealous, therefore, for thy spiritual profit, for thou shalt receive shortly the reward of thy labours, and neither fear nor sorrow shall come any more into thy borders. Now shalt thou labour a little, and thou shalt find great rest, yea everlasting joy. If thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in labour, doubt not that God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding thee. It is thy duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory, but thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or lifted up.
2. Cum enim quidam anxius inter metum et spem frequenter fluctuaret, et quadam vice moerore confectus in ecclesia ante quoddam altare se in oratione prostravisset, hæc intra se resolvit dicens: O, si scirem, quod adhuc perserveratus essem; statimque audivit divinum intus responsum. Quid, si hoc scires, quid facere velles? Fac nunc quod facere velles, et bene securus eris. Moxque consolatus et confortatus divinæ se commisit voluntati, et cessavit anxia fluctuatio. Noluitque curiose se investigare, ut sciret quæ sibi essent futura, sed magis studuit inquirere quæ esset voluntas Dei beneplacens et perfecta ad omne opus inchoandum et perficiendum.	2. A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed about between hope and fear, and being on a certain day overwhelmed with grief, cast himself down in prayer before the altar in a church, and meditated within himself, saying, “Oh! if I but knew that I should still persevere,” and presently heard within him a voice from God, “And if thou didst know it, what wouldst thou do? Do now what thou wouldst do then, and thou shalt be very secure.” And straightway being comforted and strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will of God, for the beginning and perfecting of every good work.
3.Spera in Domino et fac bonitatem,ait Propheta,et inhabita terram, et pasceris in divitiis ejus.Unum est quod multos a profectu et ferventi emendatione retrahit: horror difficultatis seu labor certaminis. Illi maxime præ aliis in virtutibus proficiunt, qui ea quæ sibi magis gravia et contraria sunt vincere nituntur. Nam ibi homo plus proficit, et gratiam meretur ampliorem, ubi magis se ipsum vincit, et in spiritu mortificat.	3. Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell in the land and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches. One thing there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent amendment, even the dread of difficulty, or the labour of the conflict. Nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth most and meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and mortifieth himself in spirit.
4. Sed non omnes habent æque multum ad vincendum et moriendum. Diligens autem æmulator valentior erit ad proficiendum, etiamsi plures habeat passiones, quam alius bene morigeratus, minus tamen fervens ad virtutes. Duo specialiter ad magnam emendationem juvant, videlicet subtrahere se violenter ad quod natura vitiose inclinatur, et ferventer instare pro bono, quo amplius quis indiget. Illa etiam magis studeas cavere et vincere quæ tibi in aliis frequentius displicent.	4. But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to mortify, yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit, although he have stronger passions, than another who is more temperate of disposition, but is withal less fervent in the pursuit of virtue. Two things specially avail unto improvement in holiness, namely firmness to withdraw ourselves from the sin to which by nature we are most inclined, and earnest zeal for that good in which we are most lacking. And strive also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which displease thee most frequently in others.
5. Ubique profectum tuum capies ut si bona exempla videas vel audias, de imitandis accendaris. Si quid autem reprehensibile confideraveris, cave ne idem facias, aut si aliquando fecisti, citius emendare te studeas. Sicut oculus tuus alios confiderat, sic iterum ab aliis notaris. Quam jucundum et dulce est videre fervidos et devotos Fratres bene morigeratos et disciiplinatos. Quam triste est et grave videre inordinate ambulantes, qui ea ad quæ vocati sunt non exercent. Quam nocivum est negligere vocationis suæ propositum, et ad non comissia sensum inclinare.	5. Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them, but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed that thou do not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it, strive quickly to amend thyself. As thine eye observeth others, so again are the eyes of others upon thee. How sweet and pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of good discipline; and how sad is it and grievous to see them walking disorderly, not practising the duties to which they are called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none of their business.
6. Memor esto arrepti propositi, et imaginem crucifixi tibi propone. Bene verecundari potes inspecta vita Jesu Christi, quia necdum magis illi te conformare studuisti, licet diu in via Dei fuisti. Religiosus qui se intente et devote in sanctissima vita et passione Domini exercet, omnia utilia et necessaria sibi abundanter ibi inveniet. Nec opus est ut extra Jesum aliquid melius quærat. O, si Jesus crucifixus in cor nostrum veniret, quam cito et sufficienter docti essemus. Religiosus fervidus bene omnia portat et capit, quæ illi jubentur.	6. Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified. Truly oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of Jesus Christ, because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform thyself more unto Him, though thou hast been a long time in the way of God. A religious man who exercises himself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall find there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything better beyond Jesus. Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts, how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we need to know!
7. Religiosus negligens et tepidus habet tribulationem super tribulationem et ex omni parte patitur angustiam, quia interiori consolatione caret, et exteriorem quærere prohibetur. Religiosus extra disciplinam vivens gravi patet ruinæ. Qui laxiora quærit et remissiora, semper in angustiis erit, quia unum aut reliquum displicebit sibi.	7. He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that are laid upon him. He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble upon trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he is without inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that which is outward. He who is living without discipline is exposed to grievous ruin. He who seeketh easier and lighter discipline shall always be in distress, because one thing or another will give him displeasure.
8. Quomodo faciunt tam multi alii Religiosi qui satis arctati sunt sub disciplina claustrali, rare execunt, abstracte vivunt, pauperrime comedunt, grosse vestiuntur, multum laborant, parum loquuntur, diu vigilant, mature surgunt, et orationes prolongant, frequenter legunt et se in omni disciplina custodiunt. Attende Cartusienses et Benedictinos, et Cistercienses ac diversæ religionis Monachos et Moniales qualiter omni nocte ad psallendum Deo surgunt. Et ideo turpe esset, ut tu debeas in tam sancto opere dormitare et pigritare, ubi tanta multitudo Religiosorum incipit Deo jubilare.	8. How do so many others, Religious men, live—who are strictly confined under monastic discipline, seldom go forth, dwell apart, eat in utmost poverty, clothe themselves coarsely, labour much, speak little, keep long vigils, rise early, prolong their prayers, read frequently, and keep themselves under strict rule in all things? Consider the Carthusians, the Benedictines, the Cistercians, and monks and nuns of many orders, how they rise each night to sing praises unto God. And shall it not be a shame unto thee to sleep and grow slothful in so holy a work, while such a multitude of Religious lift up their voices to rejoice in God?
9. O, si nihil aliud faciendum incumberet, nisi Dominum Deum nostrum tot corde et ore laudare. O, si nunquam indigeres comedere, nec bibere, nec dormire, sed semper posses Deum laudare, et solummodo spiritualibus studiis vacare, tunc multo felicior esses, quam modo carni ex qualicumque necessitate serviens. Utinam non essent istæ necessitates, sed solummodo spirituales animæ refectiones, quas heu satis raro degustamus.	9. O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God with our whole heart and voice! Oh! if thou never hadst need to eat or drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou be far happier than now, when for so many necessities thou must serve the flesh. O! that these necessities were not, but only the spiritual refreshments of the soul, which alas we taste too seldom.
10. Quando homo ad hoc pervenit, quod de nulla creatura consolationem quærit, tunc ei Deus primo perfecte sapere incipit, tunc etiam bene contentus de omni eventu rerum erit, tunc nec pro magno lætabitur, nec pro modico contristabitur, sed ponit se integre, et fiducialiter in Deo, qui est ei omnia in omnibus, cui nihil utique parit, nec moritur, sed omnia ei vivunt, et ad nutum incunctanter deserviunt.	10. When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto him. Then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for little, but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust unto God, who is all in all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor dieth, but all things live to Him and obey His every word without delay. 
11. Memento semper finis, et quia perditum non redit tempus, sine sollicitudine, et diligentia nunquam acquires virtutes. Si incipis tepescere, incipis male habere. Si autem dederis te ad fervorem, invenies magnam pacem, et senties leviorem laborem propter Dei gratiam et virtutis amorem. Homo fervidus et diligens ad omnia est paratus. Major labor est resistere vitiis et passionibus, quam corporalibus insudare laboribus. Qui parvos non devitat defectus, paulatim labitur ad majora. Gaudebis semper de vespere, si diem expendes fructuose. Vigila semper te ipsum et quidquid de aliis sit non negligas te ipsum. Tantum proficies, quantum tibi ipsi vim intuleris. Amen.	11. Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost returneth not. Without care and diligence thou shalt never get virtue. If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill with thee, but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find much peace, and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the grace of God and the love of virtue. A zealous and diligent man is ready for all things. It is greater labour to resist sins and passions than to toil in bodily labours. He who shunneth not small faults falleth little by little into greater. At eventide thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably. Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more violence thou dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit. Amen.
