Liber TertiusDe interna consolatine.	THE THIRD BOOK ON INWARD CONSOLATION
Cap. I.  Incipit liber de interna consolatine.	CHAPTER I Of the inward voice of Christ to the faithful soul
1.Audiam quid loquatur in me Dominus meus.Beata anima quæ Dominum in se loquentem audit et de ore ejus verbum consolationis accipit. Beatæ aures quæ divini susurri venas suscipiunt et de mundi hujus susurrationibus nihil advertunt. Beatæ plane aures quæ non vocem foris sonantem, sed interius auscultant veritatem loquentem et docentem. Beati oculi qui exterioribus clausi sunt, interioribus autem intenti. Beati qui interna penetrant, et ad capienda arcana cælestia magis ac magis per quotidiana exercitia se student præparare. Beati qui Deo vacare gestiunt et ab omni impedimento sæculi se excutiunt.	1. I will hearken what the Lord God shall say within me. Blessed is the soul which heareth the Lord speaking within it, and receiveth the word of consolation from His mouth. Blessed are the ears which receive the echoes of the soft whisper of God, and turn not aside to the whisperings of this world. Blessed truly are the ears which listen not to the voice that soundeth without, but to that which teacheth truth inwardly. Blessed are the eyes which are closed to things without, but are fixed upon things within. Blessed are they who search inward things and study to prepare themselves more and more by daily exercises for the receiving of heavenly mysteries. Blessed are they who long to have leisure for God, and free themselves from every hindrance of the world. Think on these things, O my soul, and shut the doors of thy carnal desires, so mayest thou hear what the Lord God will say within thee.
2. Animadverte hoc, o anima mea, et claude sensualitatis tuæ ostia, ut possis audire quid loquatur Deus Dominus in te. Hæc dicit dilectus tuus. Salus tua ego sum, pax tua, et vita tua. Serva te apud me, et pacem invenies. Dimitte omnia transitoria, et quære æterna. Quid sunt omnia temporalia, nisi seductoria et quid juvant omnes creaturæ, si fueris a Creatore deserta? Omnibus ergo abdicatis Creatori tuo te redde placitam et fidelem, ut veram valeas apprehendere beatitudinem.	2. These things saith thy Beloved, “I am thy salvation, I am thy peace and thy life. Keep thee unto Me, and thou shalt find peace.” Put away thee all transitory things, seek those things that are eternal. For what are all temporal things but deceits, and what shall all created things help thee if thou be forsaken by the Creator? Therefore put all things else away, and give thyself to the Creator, to be well pleasing and faithful to Him, that thou mayest be able to attain true blessedness.
Cap. 2. Quod veritas intus loquitur sine strepitu.	CHAPTER II What the truth saith inwardly without noise of words
1.Loquere Domine, quia audit servus tuus. Servus tuus ego sum, da mihi intellectum, ut sciam testimonia tua.Inclina cor meum in verba oris mei. Fluat ut ros eloquium tuum, dicebant olim filii Israel ad Moysen.Loquere nobis tu, et audiemus; non loquatur Dominus nobis, ne forte moriamur.Non sic, Domine, non sic oro, sed magis cum Samuele popheta humiliter ad disideranter obsecro.Loquere Domine, quia audit servus suus.Non loquatur Moyses mihi, aut aliquis ex Prophetis, sed otius tu loquere, Domine Deus, inspirator et illuminator omnium. Prophetarum, quia tu solus sine eis potes me perfecte imbuere, illi autem sine te nihil proficient.	1. Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth. I am Thy servant; O give me understanding that I may know Thy testimonies. Incline my heart unto the words of Thy mouth. Let thy speech distil as the dew. The children of Israel spake in old time to Moses, Speak thou unto us and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak unto us lest we die. Not thus, O Lord, not thus do I pray, but rather with Samuel the prophet, I beseech Thee humbly and earnestly, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth. Let not Moses speak to me, nor any prophet, but rather speak Thou, O Lord, who didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets; for Thou alone without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge, whilst they without Thee shall profit nothing.
2. Possunt quidem verba sonare, sed spiritum non conferunt. Pulcherrime dicunt, sed te tacente cor non accedunt. Litteras tradunt, sed tu sensum aperis. Mysteria referunt, sed tu referas intellectum signatorum. Mandata edunt, sed tu juvas ad perficiendum. Viam ostendunt, sed tu confortas ad ambulandum. Illi foris tantum agunt, sed tu corda instruis, et illuminas. Illi exterius rigant, sed tu fecunditatem donas. Illi clamant verbis, sed tu auditui intelligentiam tribuis.	2. They can indeed utter words, but they give not the spirit. They speak with exceeding beauty, but when Thou art silent they kindle not the heart. They give us scriptures, but Thou makest known the sense thereof. They bring us mysteries, but Thou revealest the things which are signified. They utter commandments, but Thou helpest to the fulfilling of them. They show the way, but Thou givest strength for the journey. They act only outwardly, but Thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart. They water, but Thou givest the increase. They cry with words, but Thou givest understanding to the hearer.
3. Non ergo mihi loquatur Moyses, sed tu, Domine Deus meus, æterna veritas, ne forte moriar, et sine fructu efficiar, si fuero tantum foris admonitus, et intus non accensus, ne sit mihi ad judicium verbum auditum, et non factum cognitum nec amatum creditum, et non servatum.Loquere igitur, Domine, quia audit servus tuus: verba enim vitæ æternæ habes.Loquere mihi ad qualemcumque animæ meæ consolationem, et ad totius vitæ meæ emendationem, tibi autem ad gloriam et perpetuum honorem.	3. Therefore let not Moses speak to me, but Thou, O Lord my God, Eternal Truth; lest I die and bring forth no fruit, being outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within; lest the word heard but not followed, known but not loved, believed but not obeyed, rise up against me in the judgment. Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth; Thou hast the words of eternal life.(4) Speak unto me for some consolation unto my soul, for the amendment of my whole life, and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of Thy Name.
Cap. 3. Quod verba Dei sunt audienda cum humilitate.	CHAPTER III How all the words of God are to be heard with humility
1. Audi, fili mi, verba mea. Verba mea suavissima sunt, Philosophorum et Sapientum hujus mundi scientam excedentia. Verba mea spiritus et vita sunt, nec humano sunsu pensanda; non sunt ad vanam complacentiam trahenda, sed in silentio audienda, et cum omni humilitate, atque affectu magno suscipienda. Et dixi: Beatus quem tu erudieris, Domine, et de lege tua docueris eum, ut mitiges ei a diebus maliset desoletur in terra.	1. “My Son, hear My words, for My words are most sweet, surpassing all the knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of this world. My words are spirit, and they are life, and are not to be weighed by man’s understanding. They are not to be drawn forth for vain approbation, but to be heard in silence, and to be received with all humility and with deep love.” And I said, “Blessed is the man whom Thou teachest, O Lord, and instructest him in Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest in time of adversity, and that he be not desolate in the earth.”
2. Ego, inquit Dominus, docui Prophetas ab initio, et usque nunc non cesso omnibus loqui. Sed multi ad vocem meam surdi sunt, et muti et duri. Plures mundum libentius audiunt quam Deum, facilius sequuntur carnis suæ appetitum, quam dei beneplacitum. Promittit temporalia, et parva mundus, et servitur ei aviditate magna. Ego promitto summa, et æterna, et torpescunt mortalium corda. Quis tanta cura in omnibus mihi servit et obedit, sicut mundo et dominis ejus servitur?Erubesce, Sidon, ait mare.Et si causam quæris audi, quare. Pro modica præbenda longa via curritur, pro vita æterna vix a multis pes a terra semel movetur et levatur. Vile prætium quæritur, pro uno numismate interdum turpiter litigatur, pro vana re et parva promissione die noctuque fatigari non timetur.	2. “I,” saith the Lord, “taught the prophets from the beginning, and even now cease I not to speak unto all; but many are deaf and hardened against My voice; many love to listen to the world rather than to God, they follow after the desires of the flesh more readily than after the good pleasure of God. The world promiseth things that are temporal and small, and it is served with great eagerness. I promise things that are great and eternal, and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir. Who serveth and obeyeth Me in all things, with such carefulness as he serveth the world and its rulers? Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, saith the sea; And if thou reason seekest, hear thou me. For a little reward men make a long journey; for eternal life many will scarce lift a foot once from the ground. Mean reward is sought after; for a single piece of money sometimes there is shameful striving; for a thing which is vain and for a trifling promise, men shrink not from toiling day and night.”
3. Sed, proh dolor, pro bono incommutabili, pro prætio inæstimabili, pro summo honore et gloria interminabili vel ad modicum fatigari pigritatur. Erubesce ergo, serve piger et querulose, quod illi paratiores inveniuntur ad perditionem, quam te ad vitam; gaudent illi amplius ad vanitatem, quam tu ad veritatem. Equidem a spe sua nonnunquam frustrantur, sed promissio mea neminem fallit, nec confitentem mihi dimittit inanem. Quod promisi dabo, quod dix implebo, si tamen usque ad finem fidelis in dilectione mea quis permanserit. Ego remunerator sum omnium bonorum, et fortis probator omnium devotorum.	3. “But, O shame! for an unchangeable good, for an inestimable reward, for the highest honour and for a glory that fadeth not away, it is irksome to them to toil even a little. Be thou ashamed therefore, slothful and discontented servant, for they are found readier unto perdition than thou unto life. They rejoice more heartily in vanity than thou in the truth. Sometimes, indeed, they are disappointed of their hope, but my promise faileth no man, nor sendeth away empty him who trusteth in Me. What I have promised I will give; what I have said I will fulfil; if only a man remain faithful in My love unto the end. Therefore am I the rewarder of all good men, and a strong approver of all who are godly.
4. Scribe verba mea in corde tuo, et pertracta diligenter: erunt enim in tempore tentationis valde necessaria. Quod non intelligis, cum legis, cognosces in die visitationis. Dupliciter soleo electos meos visitare, tentatione scilicet et consolatione: et duas lectiones eis quotidie lego, unam increpando eorum vittia, alteram exhortando ad virtutum incrementa. Qui habet verba mea et spernit ea,habet qui judicet eum in novissimo die.	4. “Write My words in thy heart and consider them diligently, for they shall be very needful to thee in time of temptation. What thou understandest not when thou readest, thou shalt know in the time of thy visitation. I am wont to visit Mine elect in twofold manner, even by temptation and by comfort, and I teach them two lessons day by day, the one in chiding their faults, the other in exhorting them to grow in grace. He who hath My words and rejecteth them, hath one who shall judge him at the last day.”
Oratio ad imporandum devotionis gratiam.	A PRAYER FOR THE SPIRIT OF DEVOTION
5. Domine Deus meus, tu es omnia bona mea. Et quis ego sum, ut audeam ad te loqui? Ego sum pauperrimus servulus tuus, et abjectus vermiculus tuus, multo pauperior et contemptibilior, quam scio et dicere audeo. Memento tamen, Domine, quia nihil sum, nihil valeo, nihilque habeo. Tu solus bonus justus et sanctus; tu omnia potes, omnia præstas, omnia imples, solum peccatorem inanem relinquens. Reminiscere miserationum tuarum, Domine, et imple gratia tua cor ceum, qui non vis vacua esse opera tua.	5. O Lord my God, Thou art all my good, and who am I that I should dare to speak unto Thee? I am the very poorest of Thy servants, an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than I know or dare to say. Nevertheless remember, O Lord, that I am nothing, I have nothing, and can do nothing. Thou only art good, just and holy; Thou canst do all things, art over all things, fillest all things, leaving empty only the sinner. Call to mind Thy tender mercies, and fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who wilt not that Thy work should return to Thee void.
6. Quomodo possum me tolerare in hac misera vita, nisi me confortaveris misericordia tua et gratia tua. Noli avertere faciem tuam a me, noli visitationem tuam prolongare, noli consolationem tuam prolongare, noli consolationem tuam abstrahere, ne fiatanima mea sicut terra sine aqua tibi. Doce me,Domine,facere voluntatem tuam.Doce me coram te digne et humiliter conversari, quia sapientia mea tu es, qui in veritate me cognoscis, et cognovisti antequam fieret mundus, et antequam natus essem in mundo.	6. How can I bear this miserable life unless Thy mercy and grace strengthen me? Turn not away Thy face from me, delay not Thy visitation. Withdraw not Thou Thy comfort from me, lest my soul “gasp after thee as a thirsty land.” Lord, teach me to do Thy will, teach me to walk humbly and uprightly before Thee, for Thou art my wisdom, who knowest me in truth, and knewest me before the world was made and before I was born into the world.
Cap. 4. Quod in humilitate et veritate coram Deo est conversandum.	CHAPTER IV How we must walk in truth and humility before God
1. Fili, ambula coram me in veritate et in simplicitate cordis tui quære me semper. Qui ambulat coram me in veritate, tutabitur ab incursibus vanis et veritas liberabit eum a seductoribus et detractionibus iniquorum. Si veritas te liberaverit, vere liber eris et non curabis de vanis hominum verbis. Domine verum est ut dicis, ita quæso mecum fiat. Veritas tua ipsa me doceat, ipsa me custodiat, et usque ad salutarem finem me conservet; ipsa me liberet ab omni affectione mala et inordinata at ambulabo tecum in magna cordis libertate.	1. “My Son! walk before Me in truth, and in the simplicity of thy heart seek Me continually. He who walketh before Me in the truth shall be safe from evil assaults, and the truth shall deliver him from the wiles and slanders of the wicked. If the truth shall make thee free, thou shalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for the vain words of men.” Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so with me; let Thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me safe unto the end. Let it free me from all evil and inordinate affection, and I will walk before Thee in great freedom of heart.
2. Ego te docebo, ait Veritas, quæ recta sunt et placita coram me. Cogita peccata tua cum displicentia magna et memorare, et nuquam reputes te aliquid esse propter opera bona. Revera peccator es, et multis passionibus obnoxius, et implicatus. Ex te semper ad nihil tendis, cito laberis, cito turbaris, cito dissolveris. Non habes quidquam, unde possis gloriari. Sed multa habes unde te debes vilificare, quia multo infirmior es quam vales comprehendere.	2. “I will teach thee,” saith the Truth, “the things which are right and pleasing before Me. Think upon thy sins with great displeasure and sorrow, and never think thyself anything because of thy good works. Verily thou art a sinner, liable to many passions, yea, tied and bound with them. Of thyself thou always tendest unto nothing, thou wilt quickly fall, quickly be conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone. Thou hast nought whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest reckon thyself vile, for thou art far weaker than thou art able to comprehend.
3. Nihil ergo tibi magnum videatur ex omnibus, quæ agis. Nihil grande, nihil prætiosum et admirabile, nil reputatione appareat dignum, nil altum, nil vere laudabile, et desiderabile, nisi quod æternum. Placeat tibi super omnia æterna veritas, displiceat tibi super omnia vilitas maxima tua. Nil sic temeas et fugias, sicut vitia, et peccata tua, quæ magis displicere debent, quam quælibet rerum damna. Quidam non sincere coram me ambulant, sed quadam curiositte et arrogania ducti volunt secreta mea scire, et alta Dei intelligere, se et suam salutem negligentes. Hi sæpe in magnas tentationes, et peccata, propter suam jactantiam, superbiam et curiositatem, labuntur me eis adversante. Time judicia Dei, expavesce iram Omnipotentis.	3. “Let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great; let nothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty, nothing worthy of honour, nothing lofty, nothing praiseworthy or desirable, save what is eternal. Let the eternal truth please thee above all things, let thine own great vileness displease thee continually. Fear, denounce, flee nothing so much as thine own faults and sins, which ought to be more displeasing to thee than any loss whatsoever of goods. There are some who walk not sincerely before me, but being led by curiosity and pride, they desire to know my secret things and to understand the deep things of God, whilst they neglect themselves and their salvation. These often fall into great temptations and sins because of their pride and curiosity, for I am against them.
4. Noli autem discutere opera Altissimi, sed tuas iniquitates perscrutare, in quantis dereliquisti, et quam multa bona neglexisti. Quidam portant solum suam devotionem in libris, quidam in imaginibus; quidam autem in signis exterioribus et figuris. Quidam habent me in ore, sed modicum in corde. Sunt alii qui intellectu illuminati et affectu purgati ad æterna sempe anhelant, de terrenis graviter audiunt, necessitatibus naturæ dolenter inserviunt, et hi sentiunt, quid veritatis spiritus loquitur in eis. Quia docet eos terrena despicere, et amare cælestia, mundum negligere, et cælum tota die et nocte desiderare.	4. “Fear thou the judgments of God, fear greatly the wrath of the Almighty. Shrink from debating upon the works of the Most High, but search narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins thou hast fallen, and how many good things thou hast neglected. There are some who carry their devotion only in books, some in pictures, some in outward signs and figures; some have Me in their mouths, but little in their hearts. Others there are who, being enlightened in their understanding and purged in their affections, continually long after eternal things, hear of earthly things with unwillingness, obey the necessities of nature with sorrow. And these understand what the Spirit of truth speaketh in them; for He teacheth them to despise earthly things and to love heavenly; to neglect the world and to desire heaven all the day and night.”
Cap. 5. De mirabili affectu divini amoris.	CHAPTER V Of the wonderful power of the Divine Love
1. Benedico te, Pater cælestis, Pater Domini mei Jesu Christi, qui mei pauperis dignatus es recordari. O, Pater misericordiarum, et Deus totius consolationis, gratias tibi ago, qui me indignum omni consolatione quandoque tua recreas consolatione. Benedico te semper et glorifico cum unigenito Filio tuo, et Spiritu Sancto paracleto in sæcula sæculorum, amen. Eia, Domine Deus, meus amator sancte, cum tu veneris in cor meum, exultabunt omnia interiora mea. Tu es gloria mea et exultatio cordis mei, tu spes mea et refugium in die tribulationis meæ.	1. I bless Thee, O Heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for that Thou hast vouchsafed to think of me, poor that I am. O, Father of Mercies and God of all comfort, I give thanks unto Thee, who refreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort, when I am unworthy of any comfort. I bless and glorify Thee continually, with thine only begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, for ever and ever. O Lord God, Holy lover of my soul, when Thou shalt come into my heart, all my inward parts shall rejoice. Thou art my glory and the joy of my heart. Thou art my hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble.
2. Sed quia adhuc debilis sum in amore et impefectus in virtute, ideo necesse habeo confortari et consolari. Propterea visita me sæpius, et instrue disciplinis tuis. Libera me a passionibus pravis et malis, et sana cor meum ab omnibus affectionibus inordinatis, ut intus sanatus et bene purgatus aptus efficiar ad amandum, fortis ad patiendum, stabilis ad perseverandum.	2. But because I am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue, I need to be strengthened and comforted by Thee; therefore visit Thou me often and instruct me with Thy holy ways of discipline. Deliver me from evil passions, and cleanse my heart from all inordinate affections, that, being healed and altogether cleansed within, I may be made ready to love, strong to suffer, steadfast to endure.
3. Magna res est amor, magnum omnino bonum quod solum leve facit esse onerosum, et fert æqualiter omne inæquale: nam onus sine onere portat, et omne amarum dulce ac sapidum efficit. Amor Jesu nobilis ad magna operanda impellit, et desideranda semper perfectiora excitat. Amor vult esse sursum, nec ullis infimis rebus retineri. Amor vult esse liber, et ab omni mundana affectione alienus, ne internus ejus impediatur aspectus; ne per aliquod commodum temporale implicationes sustineat, aut per incommodum succumbat. Nil dulcius est amore, nil fortius, nil altius, nil latius, nil jucundius, nil plenius, nil melius in c&aeliglo et in terra, quia amor a Deo natus est, nec potest nisi in Deo super omnia creata quiescere.	3. Love is a great thing, a good above all others, which alone maketh every heavy burden light, and equaliseth every inequality. For it beareth the burden and maketh it no burden, it maketh every bitter thing to be sweet and of good taste. The surpassing love of Jesus impelleth to great works, and exciteth to the continual desiring of greater perfection. Love willeth to be raised up, and not to be held down by any mean thing. Love willeth to be free and aloof from all worldly affection, lest its inward power of vision be hindered, lest it be entangled by any worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity. Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier, nothing broader, nothing pleasanter, nothing fuller or better in heaven nor on earth, for love was born of God and cannot rest save in God above all created things.
4. Amans volat, currit, lætatur, liber est, et non tenetur. Dat omnia pro omnibus, et habet omnia in omnibus, quia in uno summo super omnia quiescit, ex quo omne bonum fluit et procedit. Non respicit ad dona, sed ad donantem se convertit super omnia bona. Amor sæpe modum nescit, sed super omne bonum fervescit. Amor onus non sentit, labores non reputat, plus affectat, quam valet, de impossibilitate non causatur, quia cuncta sibi licere posse arbitratur. Valet igitur ad omnia, et multa implet, et effectui mancipat. Ubi vero amans deficit et jacet, amor vigilat, et dormiens dormitat, fatigatus non laxatur, arctatus non arctatur, territus non conturbatur, sed, sicut vivax flamma et ardens favilla, sursum erumpit secureque pertransit.	4. He who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not hindered. He giveth all things for all things, and hath all things in all things, because he resteth in One who is high above all, from whom every good floweth and proceedeth. He looketh not for gifts, but turneth himself to the Giver above all good things. Love oftentimes knoweth no measure, but breaketh out above all measure; love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labours, striveth after more than it is able to do, pleadeth not impossibility, because it judgeth all things which are lawful for it to be possible. It is strong therefore for all things, and it fulfilleth many things, and is successful where he who loveth not faileth and lieth down. Love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch; though fatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced, though alarmed it is not terrified, but like the living flame and the burning torch, it breaketh forth on high and securely triumpheth. 
5. Si quis amat, novit quid hæc vox clamat. Magnus clamor in auribus Dei est ardens affectus animæ, quæ dicit. Deus, Deus meus, amor meus, tu totus meus, et ego tuus.	5. If a man loveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth. For the ardent affection of the soul is a great clamour in the ears of God, and it saith: My God, my Beloved! Thou art all mine, and I am all Thine.
6. Dilata me in amore, ut discam interiori cordis ore degustare, quam suave sit amare et in amore liquefieri et natare. Tenear amore vadens supra me præ nimio fervore et stupore. Cantem amoris canticum; sequar te dilectum meum in altum. Deficit in laude tua anima mea, jubilans ex amore. Amem te plus quam me, nec me nisi propter te, et omnes in te, qui vere amant te, sicut jubet lex amoris, lucens ex te.	6. Enlarge Thou me in love, that I may learn to taste with the innermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love, to be dissolved, and to swim in love. Let me be holden by love, mounting above myself through exceeding fervour and admiration. Let me sing the song of love, let me follow Thee my Beloved on high, let my soul exhaust itself in Thy praise, exulting with love. Let me love Thee more than myself, not loving myself except for Thy sake, and all men in Thee who truly love Thee, as the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from Thee.
7. Est amor velox, sincerus, pius, prudens, longanimis, virilis, et seipsum nunquam quærens. Ubi enim seipsum aliquis quærit, ibi ab amore cadit. Est amor circumspectus, humilis et rectus, non mollis, non levis nec vanis intendens rebus, sobrius, stabilis, castus, quietus, et in cunctis sensibus custoditus. Est amor subjectus et obediens Prælatis, sibi vilis et despectus, Deo devotus et gratificus fidens, et semper sperans in eo, etiam cum sibi non sapit Deus, quia sine dolore non vivitur in amore.	7. Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong, patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never seeking her own; for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he falleth from love. Love is circumspect, humble, and upright; not weak, not fickle, nor intent on vain things; sober, chaste, steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the senses. Love is subject and obedient to all that are in authority, vile and lowly in its own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful and always trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without sorrow we cannot live in love.  
8. Qui non est paratus omnia pati, et ad voluntatem stare dilecti, non est dignus amator appellari. Oportet amantem omnia dura et amara propter dilectum libenter amplecti, nec ob contraria accidentia ab eo deflecti.	8. He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to the will of the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of God. It behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard and bitter things for the Beloved’s sake, and not to be drawn away from Him because of any contrary accidents.
Cap. 6. De probatione veri amatoris.	CHAPTER VI Of the proving of the true lover
1. Fili, non es adhuc fortis et prudens amator. Quare, Domine? Quia modicam propter contrarietatem deficis, accipis et nimis avide consolationem quæris. Fortis amator stat in tentationibus, nec callidis credit persuasionibus inimici. Sicut in prosperis ei placeo, ita nec in adversis displiceo.	1. “My Son, thou art not yet strong and prudent in thy love.” Wherefore, O my Lord? “Because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy undertakings, and too eagerly seekest after consolation. The strong lover standeth fast in temptations, and believeth not the evil persuasions of the enemy. As in prosperity I please him, so in adversity I do not displease. 
2. Prudens amator non tam donum amantis, quam dantis considerat amorem. Affectum potius attendit, quam censum, et infra dilectum omnia data ponit. Nobilis amator non quiescit in dono, sed in me super omne donum. Non ideo perditum totum, si quandoque minus bene de me, vel de sanctis meis sentis, quam velles. Affectus ille bonus et dulcis, quem interdum percipis, effectus gratiæ præsentis est, et quidam prægustus patriæ cælestis, super quo non nimium innitendum est, quia vadit et venit.	2. “The prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so much as the love of the giver. He looketh for the affection more than the value, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved. The noble lover resteth not in the gift, but in Me above every gift. “All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My saints, less than thou shouldest desire. That good and sweet affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country; but hereon thou must not too much depend, for it goeth and cometh. 
3. Certare autem adversus incidentes malos motus animi, suggestionemque spernere diaboli, insigne est virtutis et magni meriti. Non ergo te conturbent alienæ phantasiæ de quacumque materia ingestæ. Forte serva propositum, et intentionem rectam ad Deum. Non est illusio, quod aliquando in excessum subito raperis et statim ad ineptias solitas cordis reverteris. Illas enim magis invite pateris quam agis, et quamdiu displicent, et reniteris, meritum est et non perditio.	3. But to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to us, and to resist the suggestions of the devil, is a token of virtue and great merit. “Therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee, whencesoever they arise. Bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright intentions towards God. It is not an illusion when thou art sometimes suddenly carried away into rapture, and then suddenly art brought back to the wonted vanities of thy heart. For thou dost rather unwillingly undergo them than cause them; and so long as they displease thee and thou strivest against them, it is a merit and no loss.
4. Scito, quod antiquus hostis omnino nititur impedire desiderium tuum in bono, et ab omni devoto exercitio evacuare, a Sanctorum cultu, a pia passionis meæ memoria, a peccatorum utili recordatione, a proprii cordis custodia, et a firmo proposito proficiendi in virtute. Multas malas cogitationes ingerit, ut tædium tibi faciat et horrorem, et ab oratione revocet et sacra lectione. Displicet sibi humilis confessio  et, si posset, a sacra communione cessare faceret. Nec credas ei neque cures illum, licet tibi sæpius deceptionis tenderit laqueos. Sibi imputa, cum mala ingerit et immunda. Dicito illi: Vade, immunde spiritus, erubesce miser; vade immundus es tu, qui talia infers auribus meis. Discede a me, seductor pessime; non habebis in me partem ullam, sed Jesus mecum erit, tanquam bellator fortis, et tu stabilis confusus. Malo mori, et omnem pœnam subire, quam tibi consentire. Tace, et obmutesce; non audiam te amplius, licet mihi plures moliaris molestias.Dominus illuminatio mea, et salus mea: quem timebo? Si consistant adversum me castra, non timebit cor meum. Dominus adjutor meus et redemptor meus.	4. “Know thou that thine old enemy altogether striveth to hinder thy pursuit after good, and to deter thee from every godly exercise, to wit, the contemplation of the Saints, the pious remembrance of My passion, the profitable recollection of sin, the keeping of thy own heart, and the steadfast purpose to grow in virtue. He suggesteth to thee many evil thoughts, that he may work in thee weariness and terror, and so draw thee away from prayer and holy reading. Humble confession displeaseth him, and if he were able he would make thee to cease from Communion. Believe him not, nor heed him, though many a time he hath laid for thee the snares of deceit. Account it to be from him, when he suggesteth evil and unclean thoughts. Say unto him, ‘Depart unclean spirit; put on shame, miserable one; horribly unclean art thou, who bringest such things to mine ears. Depart from me, detestable deceiver; thou shalt have no part in me; but Jesus shall be with me, as a strong warrior, and thou shalt stand confounded. Rather would I die and bear all suffering, than consent unto thee. Hold thy peace and be dumb; I will not hear thee more, though thou plottest more snares against me. The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? Though a host of men should rise up against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid. The Lord is my strength and my Redeemer.’
5. Certa tanquam miles bonus; et si interdum ex fragilitate corruis, resume vires fortiores prioribus, confidens de ampliori gratia mea, et multum præcave a vana complacentia et superbia. Propter hoc multi in errorem ducuntur, et in cecitatem pæne incurabilem quandoque labuntur. Sit tibi in cautelam et perpetuam humilitatem ruina hæc superborum et de se stulte præsumentium.	5. “Strive thou like a good soldier; and if sometimes thou fail through weakness, put on thy strength more bravely than before, trusting in My more abundant grace, and take thou much heed of vain confidence and pride. Because of it many are led into error, and sometimes fall into blindness well-nigh irremediable. Let this ruin of the proud, who foolishly lift themselves up, be to thee for a warning and a continual exhortation to humility.”
Cap. 7. De occultanda gratia sub humilitatis custodia.	CHAPTER VII Of hiding our grace under the guard of humility
1. Fili, utilius est tibi et securius devotionis gratiam abscondere nec in altum te efferre, nec multum inde loqui, neque multum ponderare, sed magi teipsum despicere, et tanquam indigno datam timere. Non est huic affectioni tenacius inhærendum, quæ citius potest mutari in contrarium. Cogita quam miser in gratia, et inops esse soles sine gratia. Nec est in eo tantum spiritualis vitæ profectus, cum consolationis habueris gratiam, sed cum humiliter, et abnegate patienterque tuleris ejus subtractionem. Ita quod tunc ab orationis studio non torpeas, nec reliqua opera tua ex usu facienda omnino dilabi permittas, sed sicut potueris melius et intellexeris, libenter quod est in te facias, nec propter ariditatem sive anxietatem mentis quam sentis te totaliter negligas.	1. “My Son, it is better and safer for thee to hide the grace of devotion, and not to lift thyself up on high, nor to speak much thereof, nor to value it greatly; but rather to despise thyself, and to fear as though this grace were given to one unworthy thereof. Nor must thou depend too much upon this feeling, for it can very quickly be turned into its opposite. Think when thou art in a state of grace how miserable and poor thou art wont to be without grace. Nor is there advance in spiritual life in this alone, that thou hast the grace of consolation, but that thou humbly and unselfishly and patiently takest the withdrawal thereof; so that thou cease not from the exercise of prayer, nor suffer thy other common duties to be in anywise neglected; rather do thy task more readily, as though thou hadst gained more strength and knowledge; and do not altogether neglect thyself because of the dearth and anxiety of spirit which thou feelest.
2. Multi enim sunt qui, cum non bene eis successerit, statim impatientes fiunt aut desides.Nonenim semperestin potestatehominis via ejus,sed Dei est dare et consolari, quando vult et quantum vult, et cui vult, sicut sibi placuerit, et non amplius. Quidam incauti propter devotionis gratiam se ipsos destruxerunt, quia plus agere voluerunt quam potuerunt, non pensantes suæ parvitatis mensuram sed magis cordis affectum sequentes, quam rationis judicium. Et quia majora præsumserunt, quam Deo placitum fuit, idcirco gratiam perdiderunt cito, et facti sunt inopes, et viles relicti, qui in cælum posuerant nidum sibi: ut humiliati et depauperati discant non in alis suis volare, sed sub pennis meis sperare. Qui adhuc novi sunt et imperiti in via Domini, nisi consilio discretorum se regant, faciliter decipi possunt et illudi.	2. “For there are many who, when things have not gone prosperous with them, become forthwith impatient or slothful. For the way of a man is not in himself, but it is God’s to give and to console, when He will, and as much as He will, and whom He will, as it shall please Him, and no further. Some who were presumptuous because of the grace of devotion within them, have destroyed themselves, because they would do more than they were able, not considering the measure of their own littleness, but rather following the impulse of the heart than the judgment of the reason. And because they presumed beyond what was well-pleasing unto God, therefore they quickly lost grace. They became poor and were left vile, who had built for themselves their nest in heaven; so that being humbled and stricken with poverty, they might learn not to fly with their own wings, but to put their trust under My feathers. They who are as yet new and unskilled in the way of the Lord, unless they rule themselves after the counsel of the wise, may easily be deceived and led away.
3. Quod si sentire suum magis sequi, quam aliis exercitatis credere volunt, erit eis periculosus exitus, sed tamen retrahi a proprio conceptu non valuerint. Raro sibi ipsis sapientes, ab aliis regi humiliter patiuntur. Melius est modicum sapere cum humilitate, et parva intelligentia quam magi scientiarum thesauri cum vana complacentia. Melius est minus habere, quam multum, unde osses superbire. Non satis discrete agit, qui se totum lætitiæ tradidit, obliviscens pristinæ inopiæ suæ, et casti timoris Domini, qui non timet gratiam oblatam amittere. Non etiam satis virtuose sapit, qui tempore adversitatis et cujuscumque gravitatis nimis desperate se gerit, et minus fidenter de me, quam oportet, cogitat ac sentit.	3. “But if they wish to follow their own fancies rather than trust the experience of others, the result will be very dangerous to them if they still refuse to be drawn away from their own notion. Those who are wise in their own conceits, seldom patiently endure to be ruled by others. It is better to have a small portion of wisdom with humility, and a slender understanding, than great treasures of sciences with vain self-esteem. It is better for thee to have less than much of what may make thee proud. He doeth not very discreetly who giveth up himself entirely to joy, forgetting his former helplessness and the chaste fear of the Lord, which feareth to lose the grace offered. Nor is he very wise, after a manly sort, who in time of adversity, or any trouble whatsoever, beareth himself too despairingly, and feeleth concerning Me less trustfully than he ought.
4. Qui tempore pacis nimis securus esse voluerit, sæpe tempore belli nimis dejectus et formidolosus reperietur. Si scires semper humilis et modicus in te permanere necnon spiritum tuum bene moderare et regere, non incideres tam cito in periculum et offensam.	4. “He who in time of peace willeth to be oversecure shall be often found in time of war overdispirited and full of fears. If thou knewest always how to continue humble and moderate in thyself, and to guide and rule thine own spirit well, thou wouldest not so quickly fall into danger and mischief. 
5. Consilium bonum est ut fervoris spiritu concepto mediteris quid futurum sit abscedente lumine. Quod dum contigerit, recognita, ac denuo lucem posses reverti, quam ad cautelam tibi, mihi autem ad gloriam, ad tempus subtraxi. Utilior enim est sæpe talis probatio, quam si semper prospera pro tua haberes voluntate. Nam merita non sunt ex hoc extimanda, si quis plures visiones aut consolationes habeat, vel si peritus sit in Scripturis, aut in altiori gradu ponatur: sed si fuerit vera humilitate fundatus, et divina charitate repletus; si Dei honorem pure et integre semper quærat, si se ipsum nihil reputet, et in veritate despiciat atque ab aliis etiam despici et humiliari magis gaudeat quam honorari.	5. It is good counsel that when fervour of spirit is kindled, thou shouldest meditate how it will be with thee when the light is taken away. Which when it doth happen, remember that still the light may return again, which I have taken away for a time for a warning to thee, and also for mine own glory. Such a trial is often more useful than if thou hadst always things prosperous according to thine own will. “For merits are not to be reckoned by this, that a man hath many visions or consolations, or that he is skilled in the Scriptures, or that he is placed in a high situation; but that he is grounded upon true humility and filled with divine charity, that he always purely and uprightly seeketh the honour of God, that he setteth not by himself, but unfeignedly despiseth himself, and even rejoiceth to be despised and humbled by others more than to be honoured.”
Cap. 8. De vili exstimatione sui ipsius in oculis Dei.	CHAPTER VIII Of a low estimation of self in the sight of God
1.Loquar at Dominum meum, cum sim pulvis et cinis?Si me amplius reputavero, ecce tu stas contra me; et dicunt te testimonium verum iniquitates meæ nec possum contradicere. Si autem me vilificavero et ad nihilum me redegero, et ab omni propria reputatione defecero, atque sicut sum spulverizavero erit, mihi propitia gratia tua, et vicina cordi meo lux tua, et omnis exstimatio, quantulacumque minima, in valle nihilitatis meæ submergetur, et peribit in æternum. Ibi ostendes me mihi, quid sum, quid fui, et de quo veni,quia nihil sum et nescivi.Se mihi ipsi relinquor, ecce nihil, et tota infirmitas; si autem subito me respexeris, statim fortis efficior, et novo repleor gaudio. Et mirum valde quod sic repente sublevor, et tam benigne a te complector, qui proprio pondere semper ad imi feror.	1. I will speak unto my Lord who am but dust and ashes. If I count myself more, behold Thou standest against me, and my iniquities bear true testimony, and I cannot gainsay it. But if I abase myself, and bring myself to nought, and shrink from all self-esteem, and grind myself to dust, which I am, Thy grace will be favourable unto me, and Thy light will be near unto my heart; and all self-esteem, how little soever it be, shall be swallowed up in the depths of my nothingness, and shall perish for ever. There Thou showest to me myself, what I am, what I was, and whither I have come: so foolish was I and ignorant. If I am left to myself, behold I am nothing, I am all weakness; but if suddenly Thou look upon me, immediately I am made strong, and filled with new joy. And it is great marvel that I am so suddenly lifted up, and so graciously embraced by Thee, since I am always being carried to the deep by my own weight.
2. Facit hoc amor tuus gratis præveniens me, et in tam multis subveniens necessitatibus, a gravibus quoque custodiens me periculis, et ab innumeris, ut ver dicam, eripiens malis. Me siquidem male amando perdidi; et te solum quærendo et pure amando me et te pariter inveni, atque ex amore profundius ad nihilum me redegi. Quia tu, o Dulcissime, facis mecum supra meritum omne et supra id quod audeo sperare vel rogare.	2. This is the doing of Thy love which freely goeth before me and succoureth me in so many necessities, which guardeth me also in great dangers and snatcheth me, as I may truly say, from innumerable evils. For verily, by loving myself amiss, I lost myself, and by seeking and sincerely loving Thee alone, I found both myself and Thee, and through love I have brought myself to yet deeper nothingness: because Thou, O most sweet Lord, dealest with me beyond all merit, and above all which I dare ask or think. 
3. Benedictus sis Deus meus, quia licet ego omnibus bonis indignus sim, tua tamen nobilitas et infinita bonitas nunquam cessat benefacere etiam ingratis, et longe a te aversis. Converte nos ad te, ut simus grati, humiles, devoti, quia salus nostra es tu, virtus et fortitudo nostra.	3. Blessed be Thou, O my God, because though I be unworthy of all Thy benefits, Thy bountiful and infinite goodness never ceaseth to do good even to ingrates and to those who are turned far from Thee. Turn Thou us unto Thyself, that we may be grateful, humble, and godly, for Thou art our salvation, our courage, and our strength.
Cap. 9. Quod omnia ad Deum sicut ad finem ultimum sunt referenda.	CHAPTER IX That all things are to be referred to God, as the final end
1. Fili, ego debeo esse finis tuus supremus. Ex hac intentione purificabitur affectus tuus, sæpius ad se ipsum, et ad creaturas male incurvatus. Nam si te ipsum in aliquo quæris, statim in te deficies et arescis. Omnia ergo ad me principaliter referas qui omnia sum, qui omnia dedi. Sic singula considera sicut ex summo bono manantia. Et ideo ad me tanquam ad originem suam cuncta sunt referenda.	1. “My Son, I must be thy Supreme and final end, if thou desirest to be truly happy. Out of such purpose thy affection shall be purified, which too often is sinfully bent upon itself and upon created things. For if thou seekest thyself in any matter, straightway thou wilt fail within thyself and grow barren. Therefore refer everything to Me first of all, for it is I who gave thee all. So look upon each blessing as flowing from the Supreme Good, and thus all things are to be attributed to Me as their source. 
2. Ex me pusillus et magnus, pauper et dives, tanquam ex fonte vivo aquam hauriunt vivam.  Et qui mihi sponte et libere deserviunt, gratiam, pro gratia accipient. Qui autem extra me voluerit gloriari vel in aliquo privato bono delectari, non stabilietur in vero gaudio, nec in corde suo dilatabitur, sed multipliciter impedietur et angustiabitur. Nihil ergo tibi de bono adscribere debes, nec alicui homini virtutem attribuas, sed totum da Deo, sine quo nihil habet homo. Ego totum dedi, ego totum rehabere volo, et cum magna districtione gratiarum actiones requiro.	2. “From Me the humble and great, the poor and the rich, draw water as from a living fountain, and those who serve Me with a free and faithful spirit shall receive grace for grace. But he who will glory apart from Me, or will be delighted with any good which lieth in himself, shall not be established in true joy, nor shall be enlarged in heart, but shall be greatly hindered and thrown into tribulation. Therefore thou must not ascribe any good to thyself, nor look upon virtue as belonging to any man, but ascribe it all unto God, without whom man hath nothing. I gave all, I will receive all again, and with great strictness require I the giving of thanks.
3. Hæc est veritas qua fugatur gloriæ vanitas. Et si intraverit cælestis gratia et vera charitas, non erit aliqua invidia, nec contractio cordis, neqe privatus amor occupabit. Vincit enim omnia divina charitas, et dilatat omnes animæ vires. Si recte sapis, in me solo gaudebis, in me solo sperabis,quia nemo bonus nisi solus Deus,qui est super omnia laudandus, et in omnibus benedicendus.	3. “This is the Truth, and by it the vanity of boasting is put to flight. And if heavenly grace and true charity shall enter into thee, there shall be no envy, nor straitening of the heart, nor shall any self-love take possession of thee. For divine charity conquereth all things, and enlargeth all the powers of the soul. If thou art truly wise, thou wilt rejoice in Me alone, thou wilt hope in Me alone; for there is none good but one, that is God, Who is to be praised above all things, and in all things to receive blessing.”
Cap. 10. Quod spreto mundo dulce est servire Deo.	CHAPTER X That it is sweet to despise the world and to serve God
1. Nunc iterum loquar, Domine, et non silebo. Dicam in auribus Dei mei, et Regis mei qui est in excelso.O, quam magna est multitudo dulcedinis tuæ, Domine, quam abscondisti timentibus te.Sed quid es amantibus te? Quid toto corde tibi servientibus? Vere ineffabilis dulcedo contemplationis tuæ, quam largiris amantibus te. In hoc maxime ostendisti dulcedinem charitatis tuæ, quia cum no essem, fecisti me, et cum errarem longe a te, reduxisti me, ut servirem tibi, et præcepisti ut diligam te.	1. Now will I speak again, O my Lord, and hold not my peace; I will say in the ears of my God, my Lord, and my King, who is exalted above all, Oh how plentiful is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee!  But what art Thou to those who love Thee? What to those who serve Thee with their whole heart? Truly unspeakable is the sweetness of the contemplation of Thee, which Thou bestowest upon those who love Thee. In this most of all Thou hast showed me the sweetness of Thy charity, that when I was not, Thou madest me, and when I wandered far from Thee, Thou broughtest me back that I might serve Thee, and commandedst me to love Thee.
2. O, fons amoris perpetui, quid dicam de te? Quomodo potero tui oblivisci, qui mei recordari dignatus es? Et postquam contabui, et perii, fecisti ultra omnem spem misericordiam cum servo tuo, et ultra omne meritum gratiam et amicitiam exhibuisti. Quid retribuam tibi pro gratia ista? Non enim omnibus datum est, ut omnibus abdicatis sæculo renuntient, et monasticam vitam assumant. Nonquid non magnum est ut tibi serviam, cui omnis creatura servire tenetur? Non magnum mihi videri debet? Sed potius hoc mihi magnum et admirandum paret, quod tam pauperem et indignum dignaris in servum recipere, et dilectis servis tuis adunare.	2. O Fountain of perpetual love, what shall I say concerning Thee? How shall I be unmindful of Thee, who didst vouchsafe to remember me, even after I pined away and perished? Thou hast had mercy beyond all hope upon Thy servant, and hast showed Thy grace and friendship beyond all deserving. What reward shall I render Thee for this Thy grace? For it is not given unto all to renounce this world and its affairs, and to take up a religious life. For is it a great thing that I should serve Thee, whom every creature ought to serve? It ought not to seem a great thing to me to serve Thee; but rather this appeareth to me a great and wonderful thing, that Thou vouchsafest to receive as Thy servant one so poor and unworthy, and to join him unto Thy chosen servants.
3. Ecce omnia tua sunt quæ habeo, et unde tibi servio. Verumtamen vice versa tu mihi magis servis, quam ego tibi. Ecce cælum et terra, quæ in ministerio hominis creasti, præsto sunt et faciunt quotidie quæcumque mandasti. Et hoc parum est: quin etiam Angelos in ministerio hominis creasti et ordinasti. Transcendit autem hæc omnia, quod tu homini servire dignatus es, et te ispum daturum promisisti.	3. Behold all things which I have are Thine, and with them I serve Thee. And yet verily it is Thou who servest me, rather than I Thee. Behold the heaven and the earth which Thou hast created for the service of men; they are at Thy bidding, and perform daily whatsoever Thou dost command. Yea, and this is little; for Thou hast even ordained the Angels for the service of man. But it surpasseth even all these things, that Thou Thyself didst vouchsafe to minister unto man, and didst promise that Thou wouldest give Thyself unto him.
4. Quid dabo tibi pro istis millibus bonis? Utinam possem tibi servire cunctis diebus vitæ meæ. Utinam vel uno die dignum servitium exhibere sufficerem. Vere tu es dignus omni servitio, omni honore et laude æterna. Vere Dominus meus es, et ego pauper servus tuus, qui totis viribus teneor servire tibi, nec unquam in laudibus tuis debeo fastidire. Sic volo, sic desidero, et quidquid mihi deest, tu digneris supplere.	4. What shall I render unto Thee for all these Thy manifold mercies? Oh that I were able to serve Thee all the days of my life! Oh that even for one day I were enabled to do Thee service worthy of Thyself! For verily Thou art worthy of all service, all honour, and praise without end. Verily Thou art my God, and I am Thy poor servant, who am bound to serve Thee with all my strength, nor ought I ever to grow weary of Thy praise. This is my wish, this is my exceeding great desire, and whatsoever is lacking to me, vouchsafe Thou to supply.
5. Magnus honor, magna gloria tibi servire, et omnia per te, propter te contemnere. Habebunt enim gratiam magnam, qui sponte se subjecerint tuæ sanctissimæ servituti, et invenient suavissimam Spiritus Sancti consolationem. Consequentur magnam cordis libertatem, qui pro nomine tuo arctam ingrediuntur viam, et omnem mundanam neglexerint curam.	5. It is great honour, great glory to serve Thee, and to despise all for Thy sake. For they shall have great grace who of their own will shall submit themselves to Thy most holy service. They who for Thy love have cast away every carnal delight shall find the sweetest consolation of the Holy Ghost. They who enter the narrow way of life for Thy Name’s sake, and have put away all worldly cares, shall attain great liberty of spirit.
6. O, grata et jucunda Dei servitus, qua homo veraciter efficitur liber et sanctus. O, sacer status religiosi famulatus, qui hominem Angelis reddit æqualem, Deo placabilem, dæmonibus terribilem, et cunctis fidelibus commendabilem. O, amplectendum et semper optandum servitium, quo promeretur summum bonum, et gaudium promeretur sine fine permansurum.	6. Oh grateful and delightsome service of God, whereby man is made truly free and holy! Oh sacred condition of the religious servant, which maketh man equal to the Angels, well-pleasing unto God, terrible to evil spirits, and acceptable to all faithful ones! Oh service to be embraced and ever desired, in which the highest good is promised, and joy is gained which shall remain for evermore!
Cap. 11. Quod desideria cordis examinanda sunt et moderanda.	CHAPTER XI That the desires of the heart are to be examined and governed
1. Fili, oportet te adhuc multa discere, quæ necdum bene didicisti. Quæ sunt hæc, Domine? ut desiderium tuum ponas totaliter secundum beneplacitum meum, et tui ipsius amator non sis: sed meæ voluntatis cupidus amator et æmulator. Desideria te sæpe accendunt, et vehementer impellunt; sed considera an propter meum, an propter honorem tuum vel commodum magis movearis. Si ego sum in causa, bene contentus eris quomodocumque ordinavero. Si autem de proprio quæstu aliquid latet, ecce hoc est quod te impedit et gravat.	1. “My Son, thou hast still many things to learn, which thou hast not well learned yet.” What are they, Lord? “To place thy desire altogether in subjection to My good pleasure, and not to be a lover of thyself, but an earnest seeker of My will. Thy desires often excite and urge thee forward; but consider with thyself whether thou art not more moved for thine own objects than for My honour. If it is Myself that thou seekest, thou shalt be well content with whatsoever I shall ordain; but if any pursuit of thine own lieth hidden within thee, behold it is this which hindereth and weigheth thee down.
2. Cave ergo ne nimium innitaris super desiderio præconcepto, me non consulto, ne forte postea pæniteat et displiceat quod primo placuit, et quasi pro meliore zelasti. Non enim omnis affectio, quæ videtur bona, statim est sequenda: sed neque omnis contraria affectio ad primum fugienda. Expedit interdum refrænatione uti, etiam in bonis studiis et desideriis, ne per importunitatem mentis distractionem incurra, ne aliis per indisciplinationem scandalum generes, vel etiam per resistentiam aliorum subito turberis et corruas.	2. “Beware, therefore, lest thou strive too earnestly after some desire which thou hast conceived, without taking counsel of Me; lest haply it repent thee afterwards, and that displease thee which before pleased, and for which thou didst long as for a great good. For not every affection which seemeth good is to be forthwith followed; neither is every opposite affection to be immediately avoided. Sometimes it is expedient to use restraint even in good desires and wishes, lest through importunity thou fall into distraction of mind, lest through want of discipline thou become a stumbling-block to others, or lest by the resistance of others thou be suddenly disturbed and brought to confusion.
3. Interdum vero oportet violentia uti, et viriliter appetitui sensitivo contraire, nec advertere quid velit caro, et quid non velit; sed hoc magis fatagere ut subjecta sit etiam nolens spiritui, et tamdiu castigari debet et cogi servituti subesse, donec parata sit ad omnia, paucisque contentari discat, et simplicibus delectari nec contra aliquod inonveniens murmurare.	3. “Sometimes, indeed, it is needful to use violence, and manfully to strive against the sensual appetite, and not to consider what the flesh may or not will; but rather to strive after this, that it may become subject, however unwillingly, to the spirit. And for so long it ought to be chastised and compelled to undergo slavery, even until it be ready for all things, and learn to be contented with little, to be delighted with things simple, and never to murmur at any inconvenience.”
Cap. 12. De informatione patientiæ, et luctamine adversus concupiscentias.	CHAPTER XII Of the inward growth of patience, and of the struggle against evil desires
1. Domine Deus, ut audio, patientia est mihi valde necessaria. Multa enim in hac vita accidunt contraria. Nam qualitercumque ordinavero de pace mea, non potes esse sine dolore et bello vita mea. Ita est, fili. Non enim volo te talem quærere pacem, quæ tentationibus careat, aut contraria non sentiat; sed tunc etiam te extimare pacem invenisse, cum tu fueris variis tribulationibus exercitatus, et in multis contrarietatibus probatus.	1. O Lord God, I see that patience is very necessary unto me; for many things in this life fall out contrary. For howsoever I may have contrived for my peace, my life cannot go on without strife and trouble. “Thou speakest truly, My Son. For I will not that thou seek such a peace as is without trials, and knoweth no adversities; but rather that thou shouldest judge thyself to have found peace, when thou art tried with manifold tribulations, and proved by many adversities. 
2. Si dixeris te non multa posse pati, quomodo tunc sustinebis ignem purgatorii? De duobus malis semper minus tamen est eligendum: ut ergo æterna futura supplicia possis evadere, mala præsentia studeas pro Deo æquanimiter tolerare. An putas quod homines sæculi hujus nihil, aut parum patiantur? Nec hoc invenies, etiamsi delicatissimos quæsieris. Sed habent, inquies, multas delectationes, et proprias sequuntur voluntates: ideoque parum ponderant suas tribulationes. Esto quod ita sit, quod habeant quidquid voluerint, sed quamdiu putas durabit?	2. If thou shalt say that thou art not able to bear much, how then wilt thou sustain the fire hereafter? Of two evils we should always choose the less. Therefore, that thou mayest escape eternal torments hereafter, strive on God’s behalf to endure present evils bravely. Thinkest thou that the children of this world suffer nought, or but little? Thou wilt not find it so, even though thou find out the most prosperous. “‘But,’ thou wilt say, ‘they have many delights, and they follow their own wills, and thus they bear lightly their tribulations.’ “Be it so, grant that they have what they list; but how long, thinkest thou, will it last?  
3. Ecce quemadmodum sumus deficient in sæculo abundantes, et nulla erit recordatio præteritorum gaudiorum. Sed et cum adhuc vivunt, non sine amaritudine et tædio ac timore in eis quiescunt. Ex eadem namque re, unde delectationem concipiunt, sibi inde doloris pœnam frequenter recipiunt. Juste illis fit ut quia inordinate delectationes quærunt et sequuntur, non sine amaritudine et confusione eas expleant.	3. Behold, like the smoke those who are rich in this world will pass away, and no record shall remain of their past joys. Yea, even while they yet live, they rest not without bitterness and weariness and fear. For from the very same thing wherein they find delight, thence they oftentimes have the punishment of sorrow. Justly it befalleth them, that because out of measure they seek out and pursue pleasures, they enjoy them not without confusion and bitterness. 
4. O, quam breves, quam falsæ, quam inordinatæ, et turpes omnes sunt. Verumtamen præ ebrietate et cæcitate non intelligunt, sed velut muta animalia, propter modicum corruptibilis vitæ delectamentum, mortem animæ incurrunt. Tu ergo, fili,post concupiscentias tuas non eas: et a voluntate tua avertere; delectare in Domino, et dabit tibi petitiones cordis tui.	4. Oh how short, how false, how inordinate and wicked are all these pleasures! Yet because of their sottishness and blindness men do not understand; but like brute beasts, for the sake of a little pleasure of this corruptible life, they incur death of the soul. Thou therefore, my son, go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites. Delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee thy heart’s desire.
5. Etenim si veraciter vis delectari, et abundantius a me consolari, ecce in contemtu omnium mundanorum, et in abscissione omnium infirmarum delectationum erit benedictio tua, et copiosa tibi reddetur consolatio. Et quanto plus te ab omni creaturarum solatio subtraxeris, tanto in me suaviores et potentiores consolationes invenies. Sed primo non sine quadam tristitia et labore certaminis ad has pertinges. Obsistet inolita consuetudo, sed meliori consuetudine devincetur. Remurmurabit caro, sed fervore spiritus frænabitur. Instigabit te et exacerbabit serpens antiquus sed oratione fugabitur, insuper et labore utili aditus ei magnus obstruetur.	5. “For if thou wilt truly find delight, and be abundantly comforted of Me, behold in the contempt of all worldly things and in the avoidance of all worthless pleasures shall be thy blessing, and fulness of consolation shall be given thee. And the more thou withdrawest thyself from all solace of creatures, the more sweet and powerful consolations shalt thou find. But at the first thou shalt not attain to them, without some sorrow and hard striving. Long-accustomed habit will oppose, but it shall be overcome by better habit. The flesh will murmur again and again, but will be restrained by fervour of spirit. The old serpent will urge and embitter thee, but will be put to flight by prayer; moreover, by useful labour his entrance will be greatly obstructed.”
Cap. 13. De obedientia humili subditi, ad exemplum Jesu Christi.	
1. Fili, qui se subtrahere nititur ab obedientia, ipse se subtrahit a gratia et qui quærit habere privata, amittit communia. Qui non libenter, et sponte suo superiori se subdit: signum est quod caro sua nondum perfecte sibi obedit, sed sæpe recalcitrat et murmurat. Disce ergo celeriter superiori tuo te submittere, si carnem propriam optas subjugare. Citius namque exterior vincitur inimicus, si interior homo non fuerit devastatus. Non est molestior et pejor animæ hostis, quam tu ipse tibi, non bene concordans spiritui. Oportet enim te verum assumere tui ipsius contemtum, si vis prævalere adversus carnem, et sanguinem, quia adhuc nimis inordinate te diligis: ideo plene te resignare aliorum voluntati trepidas.	1. “My Son, he who striveth to withdraw himself from obedience, withdraweth himself also from grace, and he who seeketh private advantages, loseth those which are common unto all. If a man submit not freely and willingly to one set over him, it is a sign that his flesh is not yet perfectly subject to himself, but often resisteth and murmureth. Learn therefore quickly to submit thyself to him who is over thee, if thou seekest to bring thine own flesh into subjection. For the outward enemy is very quickly overcome if the inner man have not been laid low. There is no more grievous and deadly enemy to the soul than thou art to thyself, if thou art not led by the Spirit. Thou must not altogether conceive contempt for thyself, if thou wilt prevail against flesh and blood. Because as yet thou inordinately lovest thyself, therefore thou shrinkest from yielding thyself to the will of others.
2. Sed quid magnum tu, qui pulvis es, et nihil, si propter Deum te subdis homini, quando eo Omnipotens et Altissimus, qui cuncta creavi ex nihilo, me homini propter te subjeci humiliter. Factus sum omnium humillimus, et infimus, ut etiam superbiam mea humilitate vinceres. Disce obtemperare, pulvis, dice te humiliare, terra et limus, et sub omnium pedibus incurvare. Disce voluntates tuas frangere, et ad omnem subjectionem te dare.	2. “But what great thing is it that thou, who art dust and nothingness, yieldest thyself to man for God’s sake, when I, the Almighty and the Most High, who created all things out of nothing, subjected Myself to man for thy sake? I became the most humble and despised of men, that by My humility thou mightest overcome thy pride. Learn to obey, O dust! Learn to humble thyself, O earth and clay, and to bow thyself beneath the feet of all. Learn to crush thy passions, and to yield thyself in all subjection.
3. Exardesce contra te, nec patiaris tumorem in te vivere, sed ita subjectum et pulverem te exhibe, ut omnes super te ambulare possint, et sicut lutum platearum conculcare. Quid habes, homo inanis, conqueri? Quid, sordide peccator, potes contradicere exprobrantibus tibi, qui toties Deum offendisti et toties infernum meruisti? Sed pepercit tibi oculus meus, quia prætiosa fuit anima tua in conspectu meo, ut cognosceres dilectionem meam, et gratus semper beneficiis meis existeres et ad veram subjectionem et humilitatem te jugiter dares, patienterque proprium contemtum ferres.	3. “Be zealous against thyself, nor suffer pride to live within thee, but so show thyself subject and of no reputation, that all may be able to walk over thee, and tread thee down as the clay in the streets. What hast thou, O foolish man, of which to complain? What, O vile sinner, canst thou answer those who speak against thee, seeing thou hast so often offended God, and many a time hast deserved hell? But Mine eye hath spared thee, because thy soul was precious in My sight; that thou mightest know My love, and mightest be thankful for My benefits; and that thou mightest give thyself altogether to true subjection and humility, and patiently bear the contempt which thou meritest.”
Cap. 14. De judiciis Dei occultis considerandis, ne extollamur in bonis.	CHAPTER XIV Of meditation upon the hidden judgments of God, that we may not be lifted up because of our well-doing
1. Intonas super me judicia tua, Domine, et timore ac tremore concutis omnia ossa mea et expavescit anima mea valde. Sto attonitus et considero, quiacæli non sunt mundi in conspectu tuo. Si in Angelis reperisti pravitatem,nec tamen epercisti, quid fiet de me. Ceciderunt stellæ de cælo, et ego pulvis quid præsumo? Quorum opra videbantur laudabilia, ceciderunt ad infima, et qui comedebant panem Angelorum, vidi siliquis delectari porcorum.	1. hou sendest forth Thy judgments against me, O Lord, and shakest all my bones with fear and trembling, and my soul trembleth exceedingly. I stand astonished, and remember that the heavens are not clean in thy sight. If Thou chargest Thine angels with folly, and didst spare them not, how shall it be unto me? Stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall I dare who am but dust? They whose works seemed to be praiseworthy, fell into the lowest depths, and they who did eat Angels’ food, them have I seen delighted with the husks that the swine do eat.
2. Nulla est ergo sanctitas, si manum tuam retrahas, Domine. Nulla sapientia prodest, si gubernare desistas. Nulla juvat fortitudo, si conservare desinas. Nulla secura castitas, si eam non protegas. Nulla propria prodest custodia, si non adsit tua sancta vigilantia. Nam relicti mergimur et perimus; visitati autem: vivimus et erigimur. Instabiles quippe sumus, sed propter te confirmamur; tepescimus, sed a te accendimur.	2. There is therefore no holiness, if Thou O Lord, withdraw Thine hand. No wisdom profiteth, if Thou leave off to guide the helm. No strength availeth, if Thou cease to preserve. No purity is secure, if Thou protect it not. No self-keeping availeth, if Thy holy watching be not there. For when we are left alone we are swallowed up and perish, but when we are visited, we are raised up, and we live. For indeed we are unstable, but are made strong through Thee; we grow cold, but are rekindled by Thee.
3. O, quam humiliter et abjecte mihi de me ipso sentiendum est, quam nihili pendendum est si quid boni videor habere. O, quam profunde me submittere debeo sub abyssalibus tuis judiciis, Domine; ubi nihil aliud me esse invenio, quam nihil et nihil. O, pondus immensum, o pelagus instransnatabile, ubi nihil de me reperio, quam in totum nihil. Ubi est ergo latebra gloriæ? Ubi confidentia de gloria concepta? Absorpta est omnis gloria vana in profunditate judiciorum tuorum super me.	3. Oh, how humbly and abjectly must I reckon of myself, how must I weigh it as nothing, if I seem to have nothing good! Oh, how profoundly ought I to submit myself to Thy unfathomable judgments, O Lord, when I find myself nothing else save nothing, and again nothing! Oh weight unmeasurable, oh ocean which cannot be crossed over, where I find nothing of myself save nothing altogether! Where, then, is the hiding-place of glory, where the confidence begotten of virtue? All vain-glory is swallowed up in the depths of Thy judgments against me. 
4. Quid est omni caro in conspectu tuo?Numquid gloriabitur lutum contra formantem se?Quomodo potest erigi vaniloquio, cujus cor in veritate subjectum est Deo? Non eum totus mundus erigeret, quem sibi subjecit veritas. Nec omnium laudantium ore movebitur, qui totam spem suam in Deo firmavit. Nam et ipsi qui loquuntur, ecce omnes nihil, et deficient cum sonitu verborum.VeritasautemDomini manet in æternum.	4. What is all flesh in Thy sight? For how shall the clay boast against Him that fashioned it?  How can he be lifted up in vain speech whose heart is subjected in truth to God? The whole world shall not lift him up whom Truth hath subdued; nor shall he be moved by the mouth of all who praise him, who hath placed all his hope in God. For they themselves who speak, behold, they are all nothing; for they shall cease with the sound of their words, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.
Cap. 15. Qualiter standum sit ad dicendum in omni re desiderabili.	CHAPTER XV How we must stand and speak, in everything that we desire
1. Fili, si dicas in omni re: Domine, si tibi placitum fuerit, fiat hoc ita; Domine, si sit honor tuus, fiat in nomine tuo hoc; Domine, si mihi videris expedire et utile esse probaveris, tunc da mihi hoc uti ad honorem tuum. Sed si mihi nocivum fore cognoveris, nec animæ meæ saluti prodesse, aufer a me tale desiderium. Non enim omne desiderium a Spiritu Sancto est, etiamsi homini videatur justum, rectum et bonum. Difficile est pro vero judicare, an spiritus bonus, aut malus te impellat ad desiderandum hoc vel illud, an etiam ex proprio movearis spiritu. Multi in fine sunt decepti, qui primo bono spiritu videbantur inducti.	1. “My Son, speak thou thus in every matter, ‘Lord, if it please Thee, let this come to pass. Lord, if this shall be for Thine honour, let it be done in Thy Name. Lord, if thou see it good for me, and approve it as useful, then grant me to use it for Thy honour. But if thou knowest that it shall be hurtful unto me, and not profitable for the health of my soul, take the desire away from me’! For not every desire is from the Holy Ghost, although it appear to a man right and good. It is difficult to judge with certainty whether a good or an evil spirit move thee to desire this or that, or whether thou art moved by thine own spirit. Many have been deceived at the last, who seemed at the beginning to be moved by a good spirit.
2. Igitur semper cum timore Dei, et humilitate cordis desiderandum est et petendum, quidquid desiderabile menti occurrit, maximeque cum propria resignatione mihi totum committendum est atque dicendum. Domine, tu scis qualiter melius est mihi hoc vel illud; sicut volueris, da mihi quod vis et quantum vis et quando vis. Fac mecum sicut scis et sicut tibi magis placuerit, et major honor fuerit tuus. Pone me ubi vis, et liber age mecum in omnibus. In manu tua ego sum, gira et reversa me per circuitum. En ego servus tuus paratus ad omnia: quoniam non desidero mihi vivere, sed tibi, utinam digne et perfecte.	2. “Therefore, whatsoever seemeth to thee desirable, thou must always desire and seek after it with the fear of God and humility of heart, and most of all, must altogether resign thyself, and commit all unto Me and say, ‘Lord, thou knowest what is best; let this or that be, according as Thou wilt. Give what Thou wilt, so much as Thou wilt, when Thou wilt. Do with me as Thou knowest best, and as best shall please Thee, and as shall be most to Thine honour. Place me where Thou wilt, and freely work Thy will with me in all things. I am in Thine hand, and turn me in my course. Behold, I am Thy servant, ready for all things; for I desire to live not to myself but to Thee. Oh, that I might live worthily and perfectly.’”
Oratio pro beneplacito faciendo Dei.	A PRAYER TO BE ENABLED TO DO GOD’S WILL PERFECTLY
3. Concede mihi, benignissime Jesu, gratiam tuam, ut mecum sit et mecum laboret, mecumque usque in finem perseveret. Da mihi semper desiderare, et velle quod tibi magis acceptum est, et charius placet. Tua voluntas mea sit, et mea voluntas tuam sequatur semper, et optime ei concordet. Sit mihi unum velle, et unum nolle tecum: nec aliud posse velle, aut nolle nisi quod vis, aut nolis.	3. Grant me Thy grace, most merciful Jesus, that it may be with me, and work in me, and persevere with me, even unto the end. Grant that I may ever desire and wish whatsoever is most pleasing and dear unto Thee. Let Thy will be mine, and let my will alway follow Thine, and entirely accord with it. May I choose and reject whatsoever Thou dost; yea, let it be impossible for me to choose or reject except according to Thy will.
4. Da mihi omnibus mori quæ in mundo sunt, et propter te amare contemni, et nesciri in hoc sæculo. Da mihi super omnia desiderata in te quiescere, et cor meum in te pacificare. Tu vera pax cordis, tu sola requies; extra te omnia sunt dura, et inquieta. In hacpace in idipsum, hoc est in te uno et summo et æterno bono,dormiam et requiescam. Amen.	4. Grant that I may die to all worldly things, and for Thy sake love to be despised and unknown in this world. Grant unto me, above all things that I can desire, to rest in Thee, and that in Thee my heart may be at peace. Thou art the true peace of the heart, Thou alone its rest; apart from Thee all things are hard and unquiet. In Thee alone, the supreme and eternal God, I will lay me down in peace and take my rest . Amen.
Cap. 16. Quod verum solatium in solo Deo est quærendum.	CHAPTER XVI That true solace is to be sought in God alone
1. Quidquid desiderare vel cogitare possum ad solatium meum, non hic exspecto, sed in posterum: quia, si omnia solatia mundi hujus haberem, et omnibus deliciis frui possem, certum est quod diu durare no possent. Unde non potes plene, anima mea, consolari, nec perfecte recreari, nisi in Deo, consolatione pauperum et susceptore humilium. Exspecta modicum, anima mea: exspecta divinum promissum, et habebis abundantiam omnium bonorum in cælo; et, si nimis inordinate ista appetis præsentia, perdes æterna et cælestia. Sint temporalia in usu, æterna in desiderio. Non potes aliquo bono temporali satiari, quia ad hæc fruenda non es creata.	1. Whatsoever I am able to desire or to think of for my solace, I look for it not here, but hereafter. For if I alone had all the solaces of this world, and were able to enjoy all its delights, it is certain that they could not endure long. Wherefore, O my soul, thou canst be fully comforted and perfectly refreshed, only in God, the Comforter of the poor, and the lifter up of the humble. Wait but a little while, my soul, wait for the Divine promise, and thou shalt have abundance of all good things in heaven. If thou longest too inordinately for the things which are now, thou shalt lose those which are eternal and heavenly. Let temporal things be in the use, eternal things in the desire. Thou canst not be satisfied with any temporal good, for thou wast not created for the enjoyment of these.
2. Etsi omnia bona creata haberes, non posses esse felix et beata; sed in Deo, qui cuncta creavit, tota beatitudo tua et felicitas consistit, non qualis videtur et laudatur a stultis mundi amatoribus, sed qualem exspectant boni Christi fideles, et prægustant interdum spirituales ac mundi corde, quorumconversatio est in cælis. Vanum est et breve omne humanum solatium: beatum et verum solatium, quod intus a veritate percipitur. Devotus homo ubique fert secum consolatorem suum Jesum et dicit ad eum: Adesto mihi, Domine Jesu, in omni loco et tempore. Hæc mihi sit consolatio, libenter velle carere omni humano solatio. Et si tua defuerit consolatio, sit mihi tua voluntas, et justa probatio pro summo solatio.Non in perpetuumenimirasceris, neque in æternum comminaberis.	2. Although thou hadst all the good things which ever were created, yet couldst not thou be happy and blessed; all thy blessedness and thy felicity lieth in God who created all things; not such felicity as seemeth good to the foolish lover of the world, but such as Christ’s good and faithful servants wait for, and as the spiritual and pure in heart sometimes taste, whose conversation is in heaven. All human solace is empty and short-lived; blessed and true is that solace which is felt inwardly, springing from the truth. The godly man everywhere beareth about with him his own Comforter, Jesus, and saith unto Him: “Be with me, Lord Jesus, always and everywhere. Let it be my comfort to be able to give up cheerfully all human comfort. And if Thy consolation fail me, let Thy will and righteous approval be alway with me for the highest comfort. For Thou wilt not always be chiding, neither keepest Thou Thine anger for ever .”
Cap. 17. Quod omnis sollicitudo in Deo ponenda est.	CHAPTER XVII That all care is to be cast upon God
1. Fili, sine me tecum agere quod volo: ego scio quid expediat tibi. Tu cogitas ut homo, in multis sentis, sicut tibi humanus suadet affectus.	1. “My Son, suffer me to do with thee what I will; I know what is expedient for thee. Thou thinkest as a man, in many things thou judgest as human affection persuadeth thee.”
2. Domine, verum est quod dicis. Major est sollicitudo tua pro me, quam omnis cura quam ego possem gerere pro me. Nimis enim casualiter stat, qui non projicit omnem sollicitudinem suam in te. Domine, dummodo voluntas mea recta et firma, in te permaneat, fac de me quidquid tibi placuerit. Non enim potest esse nisi bonum quidquid de me feceris. Si me vis esse in tenebris, sis benedictus; et si me vis esse in luce, sis iterum benedictus. Si me dignaris consolari, sis benedictus; si me vis tribulari, æque sis semper benedictus.	2. Lord, what Thou sayest is true. Greater is Thy care for me than all the care which I am able to take for myself. For too insecurely doth he stand who casteth not all his care upon Thee. Lord, so long as my will standeth right and firm in Thee, do with me what Thou wilt, for whatsoever Thou shalt do with me cannot be aught but good. Blessed be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in darkness: blessed also be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in light. Blessed be Thou if Thou vouchsafe to comfort me, and always blessed be Thou if Thou cause me to be troubled.
3. Fili, sic oportet te stare, si mecum desideras ambulare. Ita promtus debes esse ad patiendum, sicut ad gaudendum. Ita libenter debes esse inops et pauper, sicut plenus, et dives.	3. “My Son! even thus thou must stand if thou desirest to walk with Me. Thou must be ready alike for suffering or rejoicing. Thou must be poor and needy as willingly as full and rich.”
4. Domine, libenter patiar pro te sicut volueris venire super me. Indifferenter volo de manu tua bonum et malum, dulce et amarum, lætum et triste suscipere, et pro omnibus mihi contingentibus gratias agere. Custodi me ab omni peccato, et non timebo mortem neque infernum. Dummodo in æternum non projicias, nec deleas me de libro vitæ, non mihi nocebit quidquid veniret tribulationis super me.	4. Lord, I will willingly bear for Thee whatsoever Thou wilt have to come upon me. Without choice I will receive from Thy hand good and evil, sweet and bitter, joy and sadness, and will give Thee thanks for all things which shall happen unto me. Keep me from all sin, and I will not fear death nor hell. Only cast me not away for ever, nor blot me out of the book of life. Then no tribulation which shall come upon me shall do me hurt.
Cap. 18. Quod temporales miseriæ Christi exemplo æquanimiter sunt ferendæ.	CHAPTER XVIII That temporal miseries are to be borne patiently after the example of Christ
1. Fili, ego descendi de cælo pro tua salute; suscepi tuas miserias, non necessitate, sed charitate trahente ut patientiam disceres et temporales miserias non indignanter ferres. Nam ab hora ortus mei usque ad exitum in cruce non defuit mihi tolerantia doloris, at defectum rerum temporalium magnum habui. Multas querimonias de me frequenter audivi, confusiones et opprobria benigne sustinui, pro miraculis blasphemias, pro doctrina reprehensiones.	1. “My Son! I came down from heaven for thy salvation; I took upon Me thy miseries not of necessity, but drawn by love that thou mightest learn patience and mightest bear temporal miseries without murmuring. For from the hour of My birth, until My death upon the Cross, I ceased not from bearing of sorrow; I had much lack of temporal things; I oftentimes heard many reproaches against Myself; I gently bore contradictions and hard words; I received ingratitude for benefits, blasphemies for My miracles, rebukes for My doctrine.”
2. Domine, quia fuisti patiens in vita tua, in hoc maxime implendo præceptum Patris tui, dignum est ut ego misellus peccator secundum voluntatem tuam patienter me sustineam, et donec ipse volueris, onus corruptibilis vitæ pro salute mea portem. Nam etsi sentitur onerosa præsens vita, facta est tamen jam per gratiam tuam valde meritoria, atque exemplo tuo atque Sanctorum tuorum vestigiis infirmis tolerabilior, et clarior. Sed et multo magis consolatioria, quam olim in veteri Testamento fuerat, cum porta cæli clausa persisteret, et obscurior etiam via videbatur, quando tam pauci regnum cælorum quærere curabant. Sed neque qui tunc justi erant et salvandi ante passionem tuam et sacræ mortis obitum, cæleste regnum poterant introire.	2. Lord, because Thou wast patient in Thy life, herein most of all fulfilling the commandment of Thy Father, it is well that I, miserable sinner, should patiently bear myself according to Thy will, and as long as Thou wilt have it so, should bear about with me for my salvation, the burden of this corruptible life. For although the present life seemeth burdensome, it is nevertheless already made very full of merit through Thy grace, and to those who are weak it becometh easier and brighter through Thy example and the footsteps of Thy saints; but it is also much more full of consolation than it was of old, under the old Testament, when the gate of heaven remained shut; and even the way to heaven seemed more obscure when so few cared to seek after the heavenly kingdom. But not even those who were then just and in the way of salvation were able, before Thy Passion and the ransom of Thy holy Death, to enter the kingdom of heaven.
3. O, quantas tibi gratias teneor referre, quia rectam et bonam viam dignatus es mihi et cinctis fidelibus ad æternum regnum ostendere tuum. Nam vita tua via nostra, et per sanctam patietiam ambulamus ad te, qui es corona nostra. Nisi tu nos præcessisses et docuisses, quis sequi curaret? Heu quanti longe retrocenderent, nisi tua præclara exempla inspicerent. Ecce adhuc tepescimus auditis tot signis tuis et doctrinis. Quid fieret si tantum lumen ad sequendum te non haberemus?	3. Oh what great thanks am I bound to give Thee, who hast vouchsafed to show me and all faithful people the good and right way to Thine eternal kingdom, for Thy way is our way, and by holy patience we walk to Thee who art our Crown. If Thou hadst not gone before and taught us, who would care to follow? Oh, how far would they have gone backward if they had not beheld Thy glorious example! Behold we are still lukewarm, though we have heard of Thy many signs and discourses; what would become of us if we had not such a light to help us follow Thee?
Cap. 19. De tolerantia injuriarum, et quis verus patiens perhibetur.	CHAPTER XIX Of bearing injuries, and who shall be approved as truly patient
1. Quid est quod loqueris o fili? Cessa conqueri, considera meam et aliorum Sanctorum passionem.Nondum usque ad sanguinem restitisti. Parum est quod tu pateris in comparatione eorum, qui tam multa passi sunt, tam fortiter tentati, tam graviter tribulati, tam multipliciter probati, et exercitati. Oportet igitur aliorum graviora ad mentem reducere, ut levius feras tua minima. Et si tibi minima non videntur, vide ne et hoc tua faciat impatientia. Sive tamen parva, sive magna sint, stude cuncta patienter ferre.	1. “What sayest thou, My Son? Cease to complain; consider My suffering and that of My saints. Thou hast not yet resisted unto blood. It is little which thou sufferest in comparison with those who have suffered so many things, have been so strongly tempted, so grievously troubled, so manywise proved and tried. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more grievous sufferings of others that thou mightest bear thy lesser ones more easily, and if they seem not to thee little, see that it is not thy impatience which is the cause of this. But whether they be little or whether they be great, study to bear them all with patience.
2. Quanto melius te ad patiendum disponis, tanto sapientius agis, et amplius promereris et feres levius animo et usu ad hoc non segniter paratus. Nec dica: Non valeo hæc ab homine tali pati, nec hujuscemodi mihi patienda sunt: grave enim intulit damnum, et improperat mihi quæ nunquam cogitaveram; sed ab alio libenter patiar, et sicut patienda videro. Insipiens est talis cogitatio, quæ virtutem patientiæ non considerat, nec a quo coronanda erit; sed magis personas, et offensas sibi illatas perpendit.	2. “So far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently, so far thou dost wisely and art deserving of the more merit; thou shalt also bear the more easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained hereunto. And say not ‘I cannot bear these things from such a man, nor are things of this kind to be borne by me, for he hath done me grievous harm and imputeth to me what I had never thought: but from another I will suffer patiently, such things as I see I ought to suffer.’ Foolish is such a thought as this, for it considereth not the virtue of patience, nor by whom that virtue is to be crowned, but it rather weigheth persons and offences against self.
3. Non est verus patiens qui non vult pati, nisi quantum sibi visum fuerit, et a quo sibi placuerit. Verus autem patiens non attendit a quo homine, utrum a Prælato suo, an ab alio æquali, an inferior, utrum a bono, et sancto viro, vel a perverso, et indigno exerceatur. Sed indifferenter ab omni creatura, quantumcumque et quotiescumque ei aliquid adversi acciderit, totum hoc gratanter de manu Dei accipit, et ingens lucrum reputat, quia nihil apud Deum, quantumlibet parvum pro Deo tamen passum, poterit sine merito transire.	3. “He is not truly patient who will only suffer as far as seemeth right to himself and from whom he pleaseth. But the truly patient man considereth not by what man he is tried, whether by one above him, or by an equal or inferior, whether by a good and holy man, or a perverse and unworthy; but indifferently from every creature, whatsoever or how often soever adversity happeneth to him, he gratefully accepteth all from the hand of God and counteth it great gain: for with God nothing which is borne for His sake, however small, shall lose its reward.
4. Esto igitur expeditus ad pugnam, si vis habere victoriam. Sine certamine non potes venire ad patientiæ coronam; si pati non vis, recusas coronari. Si autem coronari desideras, certa viriliter, sustine patienter. Sine labore non tenditur ad requiem, nec sine pugna pervenitur ad victoriam.	4. “Be thou therefore ready for the fight if thou wilt have the victory. Without striving thou canst not win the crown of patience; if thou wilt not suffer thou refusest to be crowned. But if thou desirest to be crowned, strive manfully, endure patiently. Without labour thou drawest not near to rest, nor without fighting comest thou to victory.”
5. Fac mihi possibile, Domine, per gratiam, quod mihi impossibiel videtur per naturam. Tu scis quod modicum possum pati, et quod cito dejicior, levi exsurgente adversitate. Efficiatur mihi quælibet exercitatio tribulationis, pro nomine tuo amabilis, et acceptabilis: nam pati et vexari pro te valde salubre est animæ meæ.	5. Make possible to me, O Lord, by grace what seemeth impossible to me by nature. Thou knowest how little I am able to bear, and how quickly I am cast down when a like adversity riseth up against me. Whatsoever trial of tribulation may come to me, may it become unto me pleasing and acceptable, for to suffer and be vexed for Thy sake is exceeding healthful to the soul.
Cap. 20. De confessione propriæ infirmitatis, et hujus vitæ miseriis.	CHAPTER XX Of confession of our infirmity and of the miseries of this life
1.Confiteor adversum me injustitiam meam; confitebor tibi, Domini, infirmitatem meam. Sæpe parva res est quæ dejicit et contristat. Præpono me firmiter acturum, sed cum modica tentatio venerit, magis mihi sit angustia. Valde vilis quandoque res est, unde gravis tentatio provenit; dum puto me aliquantulum tutum, cum non sentio, invenio me nonnunquam pæne devictum ex levi flatu.	1. I will acknowledge my sin unto Thee; I will confess to Thee, Lord, my infirmity. It is often a small thing which casteth me down and maketh me sad. I resolve that I will act bravely, but when a little temptation cometh, immediately I am in a great strait. Wonderfully small sometimes is the matter whence a grievous temptation cometh, and whilst I imagine myself safe for a little space; when I am not considering, I find myself often almost overcome by a little puff of wind.
2. Vide ergo, Domine, humilitatem meam, et fragilitatem tibi undique notam. Miserere mei, eteripe me de luto, ut non infigar, non permaneam devictus usquequaque. Hoc est quod me frequenter reverberat, et coram te confundit, quod tam labilis sum, et infirmus ad resistendum passionibus, et si non omnino ad consensionem, tamen mihi etiam molesta et gravis est earum infectatio, et tædet valde sic quotidie vivere in lite. Exhinc nota sit mihi infirmitas mea, quia multo facilius irrunt abominandæ semper phantasiæ, quam discedunt.	2. Behold, therefore, O Lord, my humility and my frailty, which is altogether known to Thee. Be merciful unto me, and draw me out of the mire that I sink not , lest I ever remain cast down. This is what frequently throweth me backward and confoundeth me before Thee, that I am so liable to fall, so weak to resist my passions. And though their assault is not altogether according to my will, it is violent and grievous, and it altogether wearieth me to live thus daily in conflict. Herein is my infirmity made known to me, that hateful fancies always rush in far more easily than they depart.
3. Utinam, fortissime Deus Israel, zelator animarum fidelium, respicias servi tui laborem et dolorem, adsistasque illi in omnibus ad quæcumque perrexerit. Robora me cælesti fortitudine, neque vetus homo, misera caro spiritui necdum bene subjecta valeat dominari, adversus quam certare oportebit, quamdiu spiratur in hac vita miserrima. Heu, qualis est hæc vita? Ubi non desunt tribulationes, et miseriæ; ubi plena laqueis, et hostibus sunt omnia. Nam una tribulatione seu tentatione recedente, alia accedit, sed et adhuc priore durante conflictu aliæ plures superveniunt et insperatæ.	3. Oh that Thou, most mighty God of Israel, Lover of all faithful souls, wouldst look upon the labour and sorrow of Thy servant, and give him help in all things whereunto he striveth. Strengthen me with heavenly fortitude, lest the old man, this miserable flesh, not being yet fully subdued to the spirit, prevail to rule over me; against which I ought to strive so long as I remain in this most miserable life. Oh what a life is this, where tribulations and miseries cease not, where all things are full of snares and of enemies, for when one tribulation or temptation goeth, another cometh, yea, while the former conflict is yet raging others come more in number and unexpected.
4. Et quomodo potest amari vita hominis habens tantas amaritudines, et tot subjecta calamitatibus et miseriis? Quomodo etiam dicitur vita tot generans mortes et pestes? Et tamen amatur, et delectari in ea quæritur a multis. Reprehenditur frequenter mundus tanquam fallax sit, et vanus, nec tamen facile relinquitur, cum concupiscentiæ carnis dominantur. Sed alia trahunt ad amandum, alia ad contemnendum, alia ad amorem mundi,carnis desiderium, desiderium oculorum et superbia vitæ;sed pœnæ et miseriæ sequentes ea odium mundi pariunt et tædiunt.	4. And how can the life of man be loved, seeing that it hath so many bitter things, that it is subjected to so many calamities and miseries. How can it be even called life, when it produces so many deaths and plagues? The world is often reproached because it is deceitful and vain, yet notwithstanding it is not easily given up, because the lusts of the flesh have too much rule over it. Some draw us to love, some to hate. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, these draw to love of the world; but the punishments and miseries which righteously follow these things, bring forth hatred of the world and weariness.
5. Sed vincit, proh dolor, delectatio prava mentem mundo deditam, etesse sub sentibus delicias reputat, quia Dei suavitatem, et internam virtutis amœnitatem nec vidit nec gustavit. Qui qutem mundum perfecte contemnunt, et Deo vivere sub sancta disciplina student, isti dulcedinem divinam veris abrenuntiatoribus promissam non ignorant, et quam graviter mundus errat, et varie fallitur, vident.	5. But, alas! an evil desire conquereth a mind given to the world, and thinketh it happiness to be under the nettles because it savoureth not nor perceiveth the sweetness of God nor the inward gracefulness of virtue. But they who perfectly despise the world and strive to live unto God in holy discipline, these are not ignorant of the divine sweetness promised to all who truly deny themselves and see clearly how grievously the world erreth, and in how many ways it is deceived.
Cap. 21. Quod in Deo super omnia bona et dona requiescendum est.	HAPTER XXI That we must rest in God above all goods and gifts
1. Super omnia et in omnibus requiesces, anima mea, in Domino semper, quia ipse est Sanctorum æterna requies. Da mihi, dulcissime et amantissime Jesus, in te super omnem salutem, et pulchritudinem, super omnem gloriam et honorem, super omnem potentiam et dignitatem, super omnem scientiam et subtilitatem, et super omnes divitias et artes, super omnem lætitiam et exultationem, super omnem famam et laudem, super omnem suavitatem, et consolationem, super omnem spem et promissionem, super omne meritum et desiderium, super omnia dona et munera quæ potest dare et infundere, super omne gaudium et jubilationem, quam potest mens capere et sentire. Denique super omnes Angelos et Archangelos, et super omnem exercitum cæli et super omnia visibilia et invisibilia, et super omne, Deus meus, quod tu, non es: quia tu, Deus meus, super omnia optimus es.	1. Above all things and in all things thou shalt rest alway in the Lord, O my soul, for he himself is the eternal rest of the saints. Grant me, most sweet and loving Jesus, to rest in Thee above every creature, above all health and beauty, above all glory and honour, above all power and dignity, above all knowledge and skilfulness, above all riches and arts, above all joy and exultation, above all fame and praise, above all sweetness and consolation, above all hope and promise, above all merit and desire, above all gifts and rewards which Thou canst give and pour forth, above all joy and jubilation which the mind is able to receive and feel; in a word, above Angels and Archangels and all the army of heaven, above all things visible and invisible, and above everything which Thou, O my God, art not.
2. Tu solus altissimus, tu solus potentissimus, tu solus sufficientissimus et plenissimus, tu solus suavissimus et solatiosissimus, tu solus pulcherrimus et amantissimus, tu solus nobilissimus et gloriosissimus super omnia; in quo bona cuncta simul perfecta sunt, fuerunt et erunt. Atque ideo minus est et insufficiens quidquid præter te ipsum mihi donas, et de te ipso revelas, vel promittis, te non viso nec plene adepto: quoniam quidem non potest cor meum veraciter requiescere, nec totaliter contentari, nisi in te requiescat, et omnia dona omnemque creaturam transcendat.	2. For Thou, O Lord, my God, art best above all things; Thou only art the Most High, Thou only the Almighty, Thou only the All-sufficient, and the Fulness of all things; Thou only the All-delightsome and the All-comforting; Thou alone the altogether lovely and altogether loving; Thou alone the Most Exalted and Most Glorious above all things; in Whom all things are, and were, and ever shall be, altogether and all-perfect. And thus it falleth short and is insufficient whatsoever Thou givest to me without Thyself or whatsoever Thou revealest or dost promise concerning Thyself, whilst Thou art not seen or fully possessed: since verily my heart cannot truly rest nor be entirely content, except it rest in Thee, and go beyond all gifts and every creature.
3. O, mi dilectissime sponse Jesu Christe, amator purissime, dominator universæ creaturæ, quis mihi det pennas veræ libertatis, ad volandum et pausandum in te? O, quando ad plenum dabitur vacare mihi, et videre quam suavis es, Domine Deus meus? Quando ad plenum recolligam me in te, ut præ amore tuo non sentiam me, sed te solum supra omnem sensum et modum in modo non omnibus noto? Nunc autem frequenter gemo, et infelicitatem meam cum dolore porto, quia multa mala in hac valle miseriarum occurrunt, quæ me sæpius conturbant, et contristant et obnubilant, sæpius impediunt, et distrahunt, alliciunt et implicant, ne liberum accessum habeam ad te, et ne jucundis fruar amplexibus, præsto semper cum beatis spiritibus. Moveat te suspirium meum, et desolatio multiplex in terra.	3. O my most beloved Spouse, Jesus Christ, most holy lover of my soul, Ruler of this whole Creation, who shall give me the wings of true liberty, that I may flee to Thee and find rest? Oh when shall it be given me to be open to receive Thee to the full, and to see how sweet Thou art, O Lord my God? When shall I collect myself altogether in Thee, that because of Thy love I may not feel myself at all, but may know Thee only above every sense and measure, in measure not known to others. But now I ofttimes groan, and bear my sad estate with sorrow; because many evils befall me in this vale of miseries which continually disturb and fill me with sorrow, and encloud me, continually hinder and fill me with care, allure and entangle me, that I cannot have free access to Thee, nor enjoy that sweet intercourse which is always near at hand to the blessed spirits. Let my deep sighing come before Thee, and my manifold desolation on the earth.
4. O, Jesu splendor æternæ gloriæ, solamen peregrinationis animæ meæ, apud te est os meum sine voce, et silentium meum loquitur tibi. Usquequo tardat Deus meus venire? Veniat ad me pauperculum suum, et lætum faciat, mittat manum suam, et miserum eripiat de omni angustia. Veni, veni, quia nulla erit sine te quieta dies aut hora, quia tu lætitia mea, et sine te vacua est mensa mea. Miser sum, et quodammodo incarceratus, et compeditus ac gravatus, donec luce præsentiæ tuæ me reficias, ac libertati dones, et vultum amicabilem reddas ac demonstres.	4. O Jesus, Light of Eternal Glory, solace of the wandering soul, before Thee my mouth is without speech, and my silence speaketh to Thee. How long will my Lord delay to come unto me? Let Him come unto me, His poor and humble one, and make me glad. Let Him put forth His hand, and deliver His holy one from every snare. Come, Oh come; for without Thee shall be no joyful day or hour, for Thou art my joy, and without Thee is my table empty. I am miserable, and in a manner imprisoned and loaded with fetters, until Thou refresh me by the light of Thy presence, and give me liberty, and show Thy loving countenance.
5. Quærant alii pro te aliud quodcumque libuerit, et mihi aliud interim nihil placet, nec placebit, nisi Deus meus, spes mea, salus æterna. Non reticebo nec depræcari cessabo, donec gratia tua revertatur nihi, quia tu intus loquaris.	5. Let others seek some other thing instead of Thee, whatsoever it shall please them; but for my part nothing else pleaseth or shall please, save Thou, my God, my hope, my eternal salvation. I will not hold my peace, nor cease to implore, until Thy grace return, and until Thou speak to me within.
6. Ecce adsum, ecce ego ad te venio, quia invocasti me. Lacrymæ tuæ, et desiderium animæ tuæ, humiliatio tua, et contritio cordis inclinaverunt me, et adduxerunt ad te.	6. “Behold, here I am! Behold, I come to thee, for thou didst call Me. Thy tears and the longing of thy soul, thy humbleness and contrition of heart have inclined Me, and brought Me to thee.”
7. Et dixi: Domine, invocavi te, et desideravi te frui, paratus omnia respuere propter te: tu enim prior excitasti me, ut quærerem te; sis ergo benedictus, Domine, qui fecisti hanc bonitatem cum servo tuo, secundum multitudinem misericordiæ tuæ. Quid habet ultra dicere, Domine, servus tuus coram te, nisi ut humiliet se valde ante te, memor semper propriæ iniquitatis, et infirmitatis et vilitatis. Non enim est similis tui in cunctis mirabilibus cæli, et terræ. Sunt opera tua bona valde, Domine, judicia vera, et providentia tua reguntur universa. Laus ergo tibi et gloria, o Patris sapientia, te laudet et benedicat os meum, anima ma, et cuncta creata simul.	7. And I said Lord, I have called upon Thee, and I have longed to enjoy Thee, being ready to reject everything for Thy sake. For Thou didst first move me to seek Thee. Therefore, blessed be Thou, O Lord, who has wrought this good work upon Thy servant, according to the multitude of Thy mercy. What then hath Thy servant to say in Thy presence, save to humble himself greatly before Thee, being alway mindful of his own iniquity and vileness. For there is none like unto Thee in all marvels of heaven and earth. Excellent are Thy works, true are Thy judgments, and by Thy Providence are all things governed. Therefore praise and glory be unto Thee, O Wisdom of the Father, let my mouth and my soul and all created things praise and bless Thee together.
Cap. 22. De recordatione multiplicium beneficiorum Dei.	CHAPTER XXII Of the recollection of God’s manifold benefits
1. Aperi, Domine, cor meum in lege tua, et in præceptis tuis doce me ambulare. Da mihi intelligere voluntatem tuam et cum magna reverentia ac diligenti consideratione beneficia tua, tam in generali, quam in particulari memorare tibi, ut hinc valeam gratias referre. Verum scio et confiteor, nec pro minimo puncto me posse debitas gratiarum laudes persolvere. Minor ego sum omnibus bonis mihi præstitis; et cum tuam nobilitatem attendo, deficit præ magnitudine illius spiritus meus.	1. Open, O Lord, my heart in Thy law, and teach me to walk in the way of Thy commandments. Grant me to understand Thy will and to be mindful of Thy benefits, both general and special, with great reverence and diligent meditation, that thus I may be able worthily to give Thee thanks. Yet I know and confess that I cannot render Thee due praises for the least of Thy mercies. I am less than the least of all the good things which Thou gavest me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit faileth because of the greatness thereof.
2. Omnia quæ in anima habemus et in corpore et quæcumque exterius vel interius naturaliter vel supernaturaliter possidemus, tua sunt beneficia, et beneficum pium, ac bonum commendant, a quo bona cunta accepimus. Et si alius plura alius pauciora accepit, omnia tamen tua sunt, nec minimum sine te haberi potest. Ille qui majora accepit, non potest merito suo gloriari, nec super alios extolli, nec minori insultare, quia ille major et melior est, qui sibi minus adscribit, et in regratiando humilior est atque devotior: et qui omnibus viliorem se esse esistimat, et indigniorem se judicat, aptior est ad percipiendum majora.	2. All things which we have in the soul and in the body, and whatsoever things we possess, whether outwardly or inwardly, naturally or supernaturally, are Thy good gifts, and prove Thee, from whom we have received them all, to be good, gentle, and kind. Although one receiveth many things, and another fewer, yet all are Thine, and without Thee not even the least thing can be possessed. He who hath received greater cannot boast that it is of his own merit, nor lift himself up above others, nor contemn those beneath him; for he is the greater and the better who ascribeth least to himself, and in giving thanks is the humbler and more devout; and he who holdeth himself to be viler than all, and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy, is the apter for receiving greater things.
3. Qui autem pauciora accepit, contristari non debet, nec indignanter ferre, neque ditiori invidere: sed te potius attendere, et tuam bonitatem maxime laudare, quod tam affluenter, tam gratis, tam libenter sine personarum acceptione tua munera largiris.  Omnia ex te, et ideo omnibus es laudandus. Tu scis quid unicuique donari expediat, et cur iste minus et ille amplius habeat, non nostrum, sed tuum est discernere, aud quem singulorum definita sunt merita.	3. But he who hath received fewer gifts, ought not to be cast down, nor to take it amiss, nor to envy him who is richer; but rather ought he to look unto Thee, and to greatly extol Thy goodness, for Thou pourest forth Thy gifts so richly, so freely and largely, without respect of persons. All things come of Thee; therefore in all things shalt thou be praised. Thou knowest what is best to be given to each; and why this man hath less, and that more, is not for us but for Thee to understand, for unto Thee each man’s deservings are fully known. 
4. Unde, Domine Deus, pro magno etiam reputo beneficio, non multa habere unde exterius et secundum homines laus et gloria appareat: ita ut quis considerata paupertate et vilitate personæ suæ, non modo gravitatem, aut tristitiam, vel dejectionem inde concipiat, sed potius consolationem, et hilaritatem magnam; quia tu, Deus, pauperes et humiles atque huic mundo despectos tibi elegisti in familiares et domesticos. Testes sunt ipsi Apostoli tui, quosprincipes super omnem terram constituisti. Fuerunt enim sine querela conversati in mundo, tam humiles quam simplices sine omni malitia et dolo, ut etiam pati contemelias gauderent pro nomine tuo, et quæ mundus abhorret, ipsi amplecterentur affectu magno.	4. Wherefore, O Lord God, I reckon it even a great benefit, not to have many things, whence praise and glory may appear outwardly, and after the thought of men. For so it is that he who considereth his own poverty and vileness, ought not only to draw therefrom no grief or sorrow, or sadness of spirit, but rather comfort and cheerfulness; because Thou, Lord, hast chosen the poor and humble, and those who are poor in this world, to be Thy friends and acquaintance. So give all Thine apostles witness whom Thou hast made princes in all lands. Yet they had their conversation in this world blameless, so humble and meek, without any malice or deceit, that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes for Thy Name’s sake, and what things the world hateth, they embraced with great joy.
5. Nihil ergo amatorem tuum, et cognitorem beneficiorum tuorum ita lætificare debet, sicut voluntas tua in eo, et beneplacitum æternæ dispositionis tuæ, de qua tantum contentari debet et consolari, ut ita libenter velit esse minimus, sicut aliquis optaret esse maximus, et ita pacificus et contentus in novissimo loco sicut in loco primo atque ita libenter despicabilis, et abjectus, nullius quoque nominis et famæ sicut cæteris honorabilior, et major in mundo. Nam voluntas tua et amor honoris tui, omnia excedere debet, et plus eum consolari, magisque placere, quam omnia beneficia sibi data vel danda.	5. Therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth Thee and knoweth Thy benefits, as Thy will in him, and the good pleasure of Thine eternal Providence, wherewith he ought to be so contented and comforted, that he would as willingly be the least as any other would be the greatest, as peaceable and contented in the lowest as in the highest place, and as willingly held of small and low account and of no name or reputation as to be more honourable and greater in the world than others. For Thy will and the love of Thine honour ought to go before all things, and to please and comfort him more, than all benefits that are given or may be given to himself.
Cap. 23. De  4.or. magnam importantibus pacem.	CHAPTER XXIII Of four things which bring great peace
1. Fili, nunc decebo te viam pacis et veræ libertatis.	1. “My Son, now will I teach thee the way of peace and of true liberty.”
2. Fac, Domine, quod dicis, quia hoc mihi est gratum audire.	2. Do, O my Lord, as Thou sayest, for this is pleasing unto me to hear.
3. Stude, Fili, alterius potius facere voluntatem quam tuam. Elige semper minus quam plus habere. Quære semper inferiorem locum et omnibus subesse. Opta semper et ora, ut voluntas Dei integre in te fiat. Ecce talis homo ingreditur fines pacis et quietis.	3. “Strive, My Son, to do another’s will rather than thine own. Choose always to have less rather than more. Seek always after the lowest place, and to be subject to all. Wish always and pray that the will of God be fulfilled in thee. Behold, such a man as this entereth into the inheritance of peace and quietness.” 
4. Domine, sermo tuus iste brevis multum continet perfectionis; parvus est dictu, sed plenus sensu et uber in fructu. Nam si posset a me fideliter custodiri, non deberet tam facilis in me turbatio origi. Nam quoties me impacatum sentio et gravatum, ab hac doctrina me recessisse invenio. Sed tu qui omnia potes, et animæ profectum semper diligis, adauge amjorem gratiam, ut posim tuum complere sermonem, et meam perficere salutem.	4. O my Lord, this Thy short discourse hath in itself much of perfectness. It is short in words but full of meaning, and abundant in fruit. For if it were possible that I should fully keep it, disturbance would not so easily arise within me. For as often as I feel myself disquieted and weighed down, I find myself to have gone back from this teaching. But Thou, Who art Almighty, and always lovest progress in the soul, vouchsafe more grace, that I may be enabled to fulfil Thy exhortation, and work out my salvation.
Oratio contra cogitationes malas.	A PRAYER AGAINST EVIL THOUGHTS
5.Domine Deus meus, ne elongeris a me; Deus meus, in auxilium meum respice:quoniam in me surrexerunt cogitationes vanæ et timores magni affligentes animam meam. Quomodo pertransibo illæsus? Quomodo perfringam eas?	5. O Lord my God, be not Thou far from me, my God, haste Thee to help me, for many thoughts and great fears have risen up against me, afflicting my soul. How shall I pass through them unhurt? how shall I break through them?
6.Ego, inquit,ante te ibo, et gloriosos terræ humiliabo;aperiam januam carceris, et arcana secretorum revelabo tibi.	6. “I,” saith He, “will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight.” I will open the prison doors, and reveal to thee the secret places.
7. Fac, Domine, ut loqueris, et fugiant a facie tua omnes iniquæ cogitationes. Hæc est spes et unica consolatio mea, ad te in omni tribulatione confugere, tibi confidere, ex intimo invocare, et patienter consolationem tuam exspectare.	7. Do, Lord, as Thou sayest; and let all evil thoughts fly away before Thy face. This is my hope and my only comfort, to fly unto Thee in all tribulation, to hope in Thee, to call upon Thee from my heart and patiently wait for Thy loving kindness.
Oratio pro illuminatione mentis.	A PRAYER FOR ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE MIND
8. Clarifica me, bone Jesu, claritate æterni lumnis. Educ de habitaculo cordis mei tenebras universas. Cohibe evagationes multas et elide vim facientes tentationes. Pugna pro me fortiter, et expugna malas bestias, concupiscentias dico illecebrosas,ut fiat pax in virtute tua et abundantialaudis tuæ resonet in aula sancta, hoc est in conscientia pura. Impera ventis et tempestatibus; dic, mari quiesce; dic Aquiloni, ne flaveris: et erit tranquillitas magna.	8. Enlighten me, Blessed Jesus, with the brightness of Thy inner light, and cast forth all darkness from the habitation of my heart. Restrain my many wandering thoughts, and carry away the temptations which strive to do me hurt. Fight Thou mightily for me, and drive forth the evil beasts, so call I alluring lusts, that peace may be within Thy walls and plenteousness of praise within Thy palaces, even in my pure conscience. Command Thou the winds and the storms, say unto the sea, “Be still,” say unto the stormy wind, “Hold thy peace,” so shall there be a great calm. 
9.Emitte lucem tuam et veritatem,ut luceant super terram, quia terra sum inanis et vacua, donec illumines me. Effunde gratiam tuam desuper, perfunde cor meum gratia cælesti, ministra devotionis aquas ad irrigandum faciem terræ, ad producendum fructum bonum et optimum. Eleva mentem pressam mole peccatorum et ad cælestia totum desiderium meum suspende: ut gustata suavitate supernæ felicitatis pigeat de terrenis cogitare.	9. Oh send forth Thy light and Thy truth, that they may shine upon the earth; for I am but earth without form and void until Thou give me light. Pour forth Thy grace from above; water my heart with the dew of heaven; give the waters of devotion to water the face of the earth, and cause it to bring forth good and perfect fruit. Lift up my mind which is oppressed with the weight of sins, and raise my whole desire to heavenly things; that having tasted the sweetness of the happiness which is from above, it may take no pleasure in thinking of things of earth.
10. Rape me et eripe me ab omni creaturarum indurabili consolatione, quia nulla res creata appetitum meum plenarie valet quietare et consolari. Junge me tibi inseparabili dilectionis vinculo, quoniam tu solus sufficis amanti et absque te frivola sunt universa.	10. Draw me and deliver me from every unstable comfort of creatures, for no created thing is able to satisfy my desire and to give me comfort. Join me to Thyself by the inseparable bond of love, for Thou alone art sufficient to him that loveth Thee, and without Thee all things are vain toys. 
Chap. 24. De evitatione curiosæ inquisitionis super alterius vita.	CHAPTER XXIV Of avoiding of curious inquiry into the life of another
1. Fili, noli esse curiosus nec vacuas gerere sollicitudines.Quid hocvel illudad te? Tu me sequere.Quid enim ad te, utrum ille sit talis, vel talis, aut iste sic agit, vel loquitur? Tu non indiges respondere pro aliis, sed pro te ipso rationem reddas: quid ergo te implicas? Ecce ego omnes cognosco, et cuncta, quæ fiunt sub sole, video, et scio qualiter cum unoquoque sit, quod cogitet, quid velit, et ad quem finem tendat ejus intentio. Mihi igitur committenda sunt omnia; tu vero serva te in bona pace, et dimitte agitantem agitare quantum voluerit. Veniet super eum quidquid fecerit vel dixerit, quia me fallere non potest.	1 “My Son, be not curious, nor trouble thyself with vain cares. What is that to thee? Follow thou Me. For what is it to thee whether a man be this or that, or say or do thus or thus? Thou hast no need to answer for others, but thou must give an answer for thyself. Why therefore dost thou entangle thyself? Behold, I know all men, and I behold all things which are done under the sun; and I know how it standeth with each one, what he thinketh, what he willeth, and to what end his thoughts reach. All things therefore are to be committed to Me; watch thou thyself in godly peace, and leave him who is unquiet to be unquiet as he will. Whatsoever he shall do or say, shall come unto him, for he cannot deceive Me.
2. Non sit tibi curæ de magni nominis umbra, non de multorum familiaritate, nec de privata hominum dilectione: ista enim generant distractiones, et magnas in corde obscuritates. Libenter tibi loquerer Verbum meum, et abscondita revelarem, si adventum meum diligenter observares, et ostium cordis mihi aperires. Esto prudens, et vigila in orationibus et humilia te in omnibus.	2. “Trouble not thyself about the shadow of a great name, nor about the friendship of many, nor about the love of men towards thee. For these things beget distraction and great sorrows of heart. My word should speak freely unto thee, and I would reveal secrets, if only thou didst diligently look for My appearing, and didst open unto Me the gates of thy heart. Be sober and watch unto prayer,and humble thyself in all things.”
Cap. 25. In quibus firma pax cordis, et verus profectus consistit.	CHAPTER XXV Wherein firm peace of heart and true profit consist
1. Fili, ego locutus sum:Pacem relinquo vobis, pacem meam do vobis; non quomodo hic mundus dat ego do vobis.Pacem omnes desiderant: sed quæ ad veram pacem pertinent, non omnes curant. Pax mea cum humilibus et mansuetis corde, pax tua erit in multa patientia. Si me audieris, et vocem meam secutus fueris, poteris multa pace frui. Quid igitur faciam in omni re? Attende tibi quid facias et quid dicas et omnem intentionem tuam ad hoc dirige, ut mihi soli placeas, et extra me nihil cupias, vel quæras. Sed et de aliorum dictis vel factis nil temere judices, nec cum rebus tibi non commissis te implices, et poterit fieri ut parum vel raro turberis.	1. “My Son, I have said, Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you. All men desire peace, but all do not care for the things which belong unto true peace. My peace is with the humble and lowly in heart. Thy peace shall be in much patience. If thou heardest Me, and didst follow My voice, thou shouldest enjoy much peace.” What then shall I do, Lord? “In everything take heed to thyself what thou doest, and what thou sayest; and direct all thy purpose to this, that thou please Me alone, and desire or seek nothing apart from Me. But, moreover, judge nothing rashly concerning the words or deeds of others, nor meddle with matters which are not committed to thee; and it may be that thou shalt be disturbed little or rarely.
2. Nunquam autem sentire aliquam turbationem, nec pati aliquam cordis vel corporis molestiam non est præsentis temporis, sed status æternæ quietis. Non ergo exstimes te veram pacem invenisse, si nullam senseris gravitatem, nec tunc totum esse bonum, si neminem pateris adversarium, nec hoc esse perfectum, si cuncta fuerint secundum tuum affectum. Neque tunc magni aliquid te reputes aut specialiter dilectum existimes, si in magna fueris devotione aut dulcedine: quia in istis non congnoscitur verus amator virtutis, nec in istis consistit profectus, et perfictio hominis.	2. Yet never to feel any disquiet, nor to suffer any pain of heart or body, this belongeth not to the present life, but is the state of eternal rest. Therefore count not thyself to have found true peace, if thou hast felt no grief; nor that then all is well if thou hast no adversary; nor that this is perfect if all things fall out according to thy desire. Nor then reckon thyself to be anything great, or think that thou art specially beloved, if thou art in a state of great fervour and sweetness of spirit; for not by these things is the true lover of virtue known, nor in them doth the profit and perfection of man consist.”
3. In quo ergo, Domine? In offerendo te ex toto corde tuo voluntati divinæ, non quærendo quæ tua sunt, nec in parvo nec in magno, nec in tempore nec in æternitate, ita ut una æquali facie in gratiarum actione permaneas inter prospera et contraria omnia æqua lance pensando. Si fueris tam fortis et longanimis in spe, ut subtracta interiori consolatione etiam ad ampliora sustinenda cor tuum præparaveris, nec te justificaveris et sanctum laudaveris: tunc in vera et recta via pacis ambulas, et spes, indubitata erit, quod rursus in jubilo faciem meam sis visurus. Quod si ad plenum tui ipsius contemptum peveneris, scito quod tunc abundantia pacis perfrueris secundum possibilitatem tui incolatus.	3. In what then, Lord? “In offering thyself with all thy heart to the Divine Will, in not seeking the things which are thine own, whether great or small, whether temporal or eternal; so that thou remain with the same steady countenance in giving of thanks between prosperity and adversity, weighing all things in an equal balance. If thou be so brave and long-suffering in hope that when inward comfort is taken from thee, thou even prepare thy heart for the more endurance, and justify not thyself, as though thou oughtest not to suffer these heavy things, but dost justify Me in all things that I appoint, and dost bless My Holy Name, then dost thou walk in the true and right way of peace, and shalt have a sure hope that thou shalt again behold My face with joy. For if thou come to an utter contempt of thyself, know that then thou shalt enjoy abundance of peace, as much as is possible where thou art but a wayfaring man.”
Cap. 26.  De eminentia liberæ mentis quam supplex oratio magis meretur quam lectio.	CHAPTER XXVI Of the exaltation of a free spirit, which humble prayer more deserveth than doth frequent reading
1. Domine, hoc opus est perfecti viri, nunquam ab intentione cælestium animum relaxare et inter multas curas quasi sine cura transire, non more torpentis, sed prærogativa quadam liberæ mentis, nulli creaturæ inordinata affectione adhærando.	1. Lord, this is the work of a perfect man, never to slacken his mind from attention to heavenly things, and among many cares to pass along as it were without care, not after the manner of one indifferent, but rather with the privilege of a free mind, cleaving to no creature with inordinate affection.
2. Obsecro te, piissime Domine Deus meus, præserva me a curis hujus vitæ, ne nimis implicer a multis necessitatibus corporis, ne voluptate capiar ab universis animæ obstaculis, ne molestiis fractus dejiciar. Non dico ab his rebus, quas toto affectu ambit vanitas mundana, sed ab his miseriis, quæ animam servi tui communi maledicto mortalitatis pœnaliter gravant et retardant, ne in libertatem spiritus quoties libuerit valeat introire.	2. I beseech Thee, my most merciful Lord God, preserve me from the cares of this life, lest I become too much entangled; from many necessities of the body, lest I be taken captive by pleasure; from all obstacles of the spirit, lest I be broken and cast down with cares. I say not from those things which the vanity of the world goeth about after with all eagerness, but from those miseries, which by the universal curse of mortality weigh down and hold back the soul of thy servant in punishment, that it cannot enter into liberty of spirit, so often as it would.
3. O, Deus meus, dulcedo ineffabilis, verte mihi in amaritudinem omnem consolationem carnalem ab æternorum amore me abstrahentem, et ad se in intuitu cujusdam boni delectabilis præsentis male allicientem. Non me vincat, Deus meus, non me vincat caro et snaguis, non me decipiat mundus, ac brevis gloria ejus, non me suplantet diabolus et astutia illius. Da mihi fortitudinem resistendi, patientiam tolerandi, constantiam perseverandi. Da pro omnibus mundi consolationibus suavissimam spiritus tui unctionem, et pro carnali amoe tui nominis infunde amorem.	3. O my God, sweetness unspeakable, turn into bitterness all my fleshly consolation, which draweth me away from the love of eternal things, and wickedly allureth toward itself by setting before me some present delight. Let not, O my God, let not flesh and blood prevail over me, let not the world and its short glory deceive me, let not the devil and his craftiness supplant me. Give me courage to resist, patience to endure, constancy to persevere. Grant, in place of all consolations of the world, the most sweet unction of Thy Spirit, and in place of carnal love, pour into me the love of Thy Name.
4. Ecce cibus, potus, vestis ac cætera utensilia ad corporis sustentaculum pertenentia, serventi spiritui sunt onerosa. Tribue talibus fomentis temperate uti, non desiderio nimio implicari. Abjicere omnia non licet, quia natura sustentanda est; requirere auem superflua et quæ magis delectant, lex sancta prohibet: nam alias caro adversus spiritum insolesceret. Inter hæc quæso manus tua, Domine, me regat et doceat, ne quid nimium fiat.	4. Behold, food and drink and clothing, and all the other needs appertaining to the support of the body, are burdensome to the devout spirit. Grant that I may use such things with moderation, and that I be not entangled with inordinate affection for them. To cast away all these things is not lawful, because nature must be sustained, but to require superfluities and things which merely minister delight, the holy law forbiddeth; for otherwise the flesh would wax insolent against the spirit. In all these things, I beseech Thee, let Thy hand guide and teach me, that I in no way exceed.
Cap. 27. Quod privatus amor a summo bono maxime retardat.	CHAPTER XXVII That personal love greatly hindereth from the highest good
1. Fili, oportet te dare totum pro toto, et nihil tui ipsius esse. Scito quod amor tui ipsius magis nocet tibi, quam aliqua res hujus mundi. Secundum amorem et affectum quem geris quælibet res plus vel minus adhæret. Si fuerit amor tuus purus et simplex et bene ordinatus, eris sine captivitate rerum. Noli concupiscere quod non licet habere; noli habere quod te potest impedire et libertate interiori privare. Mirum quod non ex toto fundo cordis te ipsum mihi committis cum omnibus quæ desiderare potes, vel habere.	1. “My Son, thou must give all for all, and be nothing of thine own. Know thou that the love of thyself is more hurtful to thee than anything in the world. According to the love and inclination which thou hast, everything more or less cleaveth to thee. If thy love be pure, sincere, well-regulated, thou shalt not be in captivity to anything. Do not covet what thou mayest not have; do not have what is able to hinder thee, and to rob thee of inward liberty. It is wonderful that thou committest not thyself to Me from the very bottom of thy heart, with all things which thou canst desire or have.
2. Quare vano mærore consumeris? cur superfluis curis fatigaris? Sta ad beneplacitum meum, et nullum patieris detrimentum. Si quæris hoc vel illud, et volueris esse ibi vel ibi propter tuum commodum et proprium beneplacitum magis habendum, nunquam eris in quietudine, nec liber a sollicitudine, quia in omni re reperietur aliquis defectus, et in omni loco erit qui adversetur.	2. “Why art thou consumed with vain sorrow? Why art thou wearied with superfluous cares? Stand thou by My good pleasure, and thou shalt suffer no loss. If thou seekest after this or that, and wilt be here or there, according to thine own advantage or the fulfilling of thine own pleasure, thou shalt never be in quiet, nor free from care, because in everything somewhat will be found lacking, and everywhere there will be somebody who opposeth thee.
3. Juvat ergo non quælibet res adepta, vel multiplicata exterius, sed potius contemta et decisa ex corde radicitus. Quod non tantum de censu æris, et divitiarum intelligat, sed de honoris etiam ambitu ac vanæ laudationis desiderio, quæ omnia transeunt cum mundo. Munit parum locus, si deest spiritus fervoris; nec diu stabit pax illa quæsita forinsecus, si vacat a vero fundamento status cordis: hoc est, nisi steteris in me, permutare te potes, sed non meliorare. Nam occasione orta et accepta invenies quod fugisti et amplius.	3. “Therefore it is not gaining or multiplying of this thing or that which advantageth thee, but rather the despising it and cutting it by the root out of thy heart; which thou must not only understand of money and riches, but of the desire after honour and vain praise, things which all pass away with the world. The place availeth little if the spirit of devotion is wanting; nor shall that peace stand long which is sought from abroad, if the state of thy heart is without the true foundation, that is, if it abide not in Me. Thou mayest change, but thou canst not better thyself; for when occasion ariseth and is accepted thou shalt find what thou didst fly from, yea more.”
Oratio pro purgatione cordis et cælesti sapientia.	A PRAYER FOR CLEANSING OF THE HEART AND FOR HEAVENLY WISDOM
4. Confirma me, Deus, per gratiam Sancti Spiritus; da mihi virtutem corroborari in interiori homine, et cor meum ab omni inutili sollicitudine et angore evacuare, nec variis desideriis trahi cujuscumque rei vilis, aut prætiosæ: sed omnia inspicere sicut transeuntia, et me pariter cum illis transiturum, quia nihil permanens sub sole, quia omnia vanitas et afflictio spiritus. O, quam sapiens qui ita considerat.	4. Strengthen me, O God, by the grace of Thy Holy Spirit. Give me virtue to be strengthened with might in the inner man, and to free my heart from all fruitless care and trouble, and that I be not drawn away by various desires after any things whatsoever, whether of little value or great, but that I may look upon all as passing away, and myself as passing away with them; because there is no profit under the sun, and all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Oh how wise is he that considereth thus!
5. Da mihi, Domine, cælestem sapientiam, ut discam te super omnia quærere, et invenire, super omnia sapere et diligere, et cætera secundum ordinem sapientiæ tuæ, prout sunt, intelligere. Da prudenter declinare blandientem et patienter ferre adversantem, quia hæc magna sapientia, omni vento non moveri verborum, nec aurem male blandienti præbere: sic enim incepta pergitur via secure.	5. Give me, O Lord, heavenly wisdom, that I may learn to seek Thee above all things and to find Thee; to relish Thee above all things and to love Thee; and to understand all other things, even as they are, according to the order of Thy wisdom. Grant me prudently to avoid the flatterer, and patiently to bear with him that opposeth me; for this is great wisdom, not to be carried by every wind of words, nor to give ear to the wicked flattering Siren; for thus do we go safely on in the way we have begun.
Cap. 28. Contra linguas obtrectatorum.	CHAPTER XXVIII Against the tongues of detractors
1. Fili, non ægre feras, si quidam de te male senserint, et dixerint quod non libenter audias. Tu deteriora de te ipso sentire debes, et neminem inferiorem te credere. Si ambulas ab intra, non multum ponderabis volantia verba ab extra. Est non parva prudentia silere in tempore malo, et introrsus ad me converti, nec humano judicio disturbari.	1. “My Son, take it not sadly to heart, if any think ill of thee, and say of thee what thou art unwilling to hear. Thou oughtest to think worse of thyself, and to believe no man weaker than thyself. If thou walkest inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying words above their value. It is no small prudence to keep silence in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto Me, and not to be troubled by human judgment.
2. Non sit pax tua in ore hominum; sive enim bene sive male interpretati fuerint, non es alter homo. Ubi est vera pax et vera gloria? Nonne in me? Et qui non appetit hominibus placere, nec displicere timet, multa fruetur pace. Ex inordinato amore, et vano timore, oritur omnis inquietudo cordis et distractio sensuum.	2. “Let not thy peace depend upon the word of men; for whether they judge well or ill of thee, thou art not therefore any other man than thyself. Where is true peace or true glory? Is it not in Me? And he who seeketh not to please men, nor feareth to displease, shall enjoy abundant peace. From inordinate love and vain fear ariseth all disquietude of heart, and all distraction of the senses.”
Cap. 29. Qualiter instante tribulatione Deus invocandus est.	CHAPTER XXIX How when tribulation cometh we must call upon and bless God
1. Sit nomen tuum, Domine, benedictum in sæcula, qui voluisti hanc tentationem et tribulationem venire super me. Non possum eam effugere, sed necesse habeo ad te confugere, ut me adjuves et in bonum mihi convertas. Domine modo sum in tribulatione, et non est cordi meo bene, sed multum vexor a præsenti passione. Et nunc, Pater dilecte, quid dicam? Deprehensus sum inter angustias. Salvifica me in hac hora. Sed propterea veni in hanc horam, ut tu clarificeris, cum fuero valde humiliatus, et per te liberatus. Complaceat tibi, Domine, ut eruas me. Nam quid ego pauper agere possum? et quo ibo sine te? Da patientiam, Domine, etiam hac vice. Adjuva me, Deus meus, et non timebo quantumcumque gravatus fuero.	1. Blessed be thy name, O Lord, for evermore, who hast willed this temptation and trouble to come upon me. I cannot escape it, but have need to flee unto Thee, that Thou mayest succour me and turn it unto me for good. Lord, now am I in tribulation, and it is not well within my heart, but I am sore vexed by the suffering which lieth upon me. And now, O dear Father, what shall I say? I am taken among the snares. Save me from this hour, but for this cause came I unto this hour, that Thou mightest be glorified when I am deeply humbled and am delivered through Thee. Let it be Thy pleasure to deliver me; for what can I do who am poor, and without Thee whither shall I go? Give patience this time also. Help me, O Lord my God, and I will not fear how much soever I be weighed down.
2. Et nunc inter hæc quid dicam? Domine, fiat voluntas tua. Ego bene merui tribulari et gravari. Oportet itaque ut sustineam, et utinam patienter, donec transeat tempestas, et melius fiat. Potens est autem omniotens manus tua, etiam hanc tentationem a me auferre, et ejus impetum mitigare, ne penitus succumbam, quemadmodum et prius sæpe egisti mecum. Deus meus misericordia mea. Et quanto mihi difficuliu, tanto tibi facilior esthæc mutatio dexteræ Excelsi.	2. And now amid these things what shall I say? Lord, Thy will be done. I have well deserved to be troubled and weighed down. Therefore I ought to bear, would that it be with patience, until the tempest be overpast and comfort return. Yet is Thine omnipotent arm able also to take this temptation away from me, and to lessen its power that I fall not utterly under it, even as many a time past thou has helped me, O God, my merciful God. And as much as this deliverance is difficult to me, so much is it easy to Thee, O right hand of the most Highest.
Cap. 30. De divino auxilio petendo, et confidentia recuperandæ gratiæ.	CHAPTER XXX Of seeking divine help, and the confidence of obtaining grace 
1. Fili, egoDominus confortans in die tribulatoinis.Veni ad me, cum tibi non fueris bene. Hoc est quod maxime impedit consolationem cælestem, quia tardius convertis te ad orationem. Nam antequam me intente roges, me, multa interim solatia quæris et recreas te in externis. Ideoque fit ut parum omnia prosint, donec advertas, quia sum ego qui curo sperantes in me; nec est extra me valens consilium neque utile, sed neque durabile remedium. Sed jam reassumto spiritu post tempestatem reconvalesce in lucem miserationum mearum, quia prope sum, dicit Dominus, ut restaruem in universa, non solum integre, sed et abundanter et cumulate.	1. “My Son, I the Lord am a stronghold in the day of trouble.Come unto Me, when it is not well with thee. “This it is which chiefly hindereth heavenly consolation, that thou too slowly betakest thyself unto prayer. For before thou earnestly seekest unto Me, thou dost first seek after many means of comfort, and refresheth thyself in outward things: so it cometh to pass that all things profit thee but little until thou learn that it is I who deliver those who trust in Me; neither beside Me is there any strong help, nor profitable counsel, nor enduring remedy. But now, recovering courage after the tempest, grow thou strong in the light of My mercies, for I am nigh, saith the Lord, that I may restore all things not only as they were at the first, but also abundantly and one upon another.
2. Numquid mihi quidquam difficile est? aut similis ero dicenti et non facienti? Ubi est fides tua? Sta firmiter et perseveranter. Esto longanimis et vir fortis. Veniet tibi consolatio in tempore suo. Exspecta me, exspecta: veniam et curabo te. Tentatio est quæ te vexat, et formido vana quæ te exterret. Quid importat sollicitudo de futuris contingentibus, nisi ut tristitiam super tristitiam habeas?Sufficit diei malitia sua.Vanum est et inutile de futuris conturbari vel gratulari, quæ forte nunquam evenient.	2. “For is anything too hard for Me, or shall I be like unto one who saith and doeth not? Where is thy faith? Stand fast and with perseverance. Be long-suffering and strong. Consolation will come unto thee in its due season. Wait for Me; yea, wait; I will come and heal thee. It is temptation which vexeth thee, and a vain fear which terrifieth thee. What doth care about future events bring thee, save sorrow upon sorrow? Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. It is vain and useless to be disturbed or lifted up about future things which perhaps will never come.
3. Sed humanum est hujusmodi imaginationibus illudi, et parvi est adhuc animi signum, tam leviter trahi a suggestione inimici. Ipse enim non curat an veris an falsis illudat et decipiat et utrum præsentium amore an futurorum formidine prosternat. Non ergo turbetur cor tuum neque formidet; crede in me, et in misericordia mea habeto fiduciam. Quando tu te elongatum exstimas a me, sæpe sum propinquior. Quando exstimas te totum perditum, tunc sæpe magis merendi instat lucrum. Non est totum perditum, quando res accidit in contrarium. Non debes judicare secundum præsens sentire, nec sic gravitati alicui undecumque venienti adhærere et accipere, tamquam omnis spes sit ablata emergendi.	3. “But it is the nature of man to be deceived by fancies of this sort, and it is a sign of a mind which is still weak to be so easily drawn away at the suggestion of the enemy. For he careth not whether he deceive and beguile by true means or false; whether he throw thee down by the love of the present or fear of the future. Therefore let not thy heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Believe in Me, and put thy trust in My mercy. When thou thinkest thyself far removed from Me, I am often the nearer. When thou reckonest that almost all is lost, then often is greater opportunity of gain at hand. All is not lost when something goeth contrary to thy wishes. Thou oughtest not to judge according to present feeling, nor so to take or give way to any grief which befalleth thee, as if all hope of escape were taken away.
4. Noli putare te relictum ex toto, quamvis ad tempus permiserim tibi aliquam tribulationem: sic enim transitur ad regnum cælorum. Et hoc sine dubio magis expedit tibi et cæteris servis meis, ut exercitemini a diversis, quam si cuncta ad libitum haberetis. Ego novi cogitationes absconditas: quia multum expedit pro salute tua, ut interdum sine sapore relinquaris, ne forte eleveris in bono successu, et tibi ipsi placere velis in eo quod non es. Quod dedi auferre possum et restituere, cum mihi placuerit.	4. “Think not thyself totally abandoned, although for the time I have sent to thee some tribulation, or have even withdrawn some cherished consolation; for this is the way to the Kingdom of Heaven. And without doubt it is better for thee and for all My other servants, that ye should be proved by adversities, than that ye should have all things as ye would. I know thy hidden thoughts: and that it is very needful for thy soul’s health that sometimes thou be left without relish, lest perchance thou be lifted up by prosperity, and desirous to please thyself in that which thou art not. What I have given I am able to take away, and to restore again at My good pleasure.
5. Cum dedero, meum est; cum subtraxero, tuum non tuli: quia meum estomne datum optimum, et omne donum perfectum.Si dimisero tibi gravitatem, aut quamlibet contrarietatem, non indigneris, neque concidat cor tuum, quia ego cito sublevare possum, et omne onus in gaudium transmutare. Verumtamen justus sum et commendabilis multum, cum sic facio tecum.	5. “When I shall have given, it is Mine; when I shall have taken away, I have not taken what is thine; for every good gift and every perfect gift is from me. If I shall have sent upon thee grief or any vexation, be not angry, nor let thy heart be sad; I am able quickly to lift thee up and to change every burden into joy. But I am just and greatly to be praised, when I do thus unto thee.
6. Si recte sapis et in veritate aspicis, nunquam debes propter adversa tam dejecte contristari, sed magis gaudere, et gratias agere. Immo hoc unicum reputare gaudium, quod affligens te doloribus, non parco tibi.Sicut dilexet me Pater, et ego diligo vosdixi dilectis discipulis meis, quos utique non misi ad gaudia temporalia, sed ad magna certamina; non ad honores, sed ad despectiones; non ad otium, sed ad labores; non ad requiem, sed ad afferendum fructum multum in patientia. Horum memento, fili me, verborum.	6. “If thou rightly consider, and look upon it with truth, thou oughtest never to be so sadly cast down because of adversity, but rather shouldst rejoice and give thanks; yea, verily to count it the highest joy that I afflict thee with sorrows and spare thee not. As My Father hath loved Me, so love I you; thus have I spoken unto My beloved disciples: whom I sent forth not unto worldly joys, but to great strivings; not unto honours, but unto contempt; not unto ease, but to labours; not unto rest, but to bring forth much fruit with patience. My son, remember these words.”
Cap. 31. De neglectu omnis creaturæ, ut Creator possit inveniri.	CHAPTER XXXI Of the neglect of every creature, that the Creator may be found
1. Domine mi, adhuc indegeo majori gratia, si debeo illuc pervenire, ubi nemo me poterit, nec ulla creatura impedire. Nam quamdiu res aliqua me retinet, non possum libere ad te volare. Cupiebat libere volare qui dicebat:Quis dabit mihi pennas sicut columbæ, et volabo, et requiescam?Quid simplici oculo quietius, et quid liberius nil desiderante in terris? Oportet igitur omnem pertransire creaturam, et se ipsum perfecte deserere ac in excessu mentis stare, et videre te omnium Conditorem cum creaturis nil simile habere. Et nisi quis ab omnibus creaturis fuerit expeditus, non poterit libere intendere divinis. Ideo enim pauci inveniuntur contemplativi, quia pauci sciunt se a perituris creaturis ad plenum sequestrari.	1. O Lord, I still need more grace, if I would arrive where neither man nor any other creature may hinder me. For so long as anything keepeth me back, I cannot freely fly unto Thee. He desired eagerly thus to fly, who cried, saying, Oh that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. What is more peaceful than the single eye? And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth? Therefore must a man rise above every creature, and perfectly forsake himself, and with abstracted mind to stand and behold that Thou, the Creator of all things, hast among Thy creatures nothing like unto Thyself. And except a man be freed from all creatures, he will not be able to reach freely after Divine things. Therefore few are found who give themselves to contemplation, because few know how to separate themselves entirely from perishing and created things.
2. Ad hoc magna requiritur gratia, quæ animam levet et supra semetipsam rapiat. Et nisi homo sit super se levatus in spiritu, et ab omnibus creaturis liberatus ac Deo totus unitus quidquid scit, quidquid etiam habet, non est magni ponderis, diu parvus erit. Et infra jacebit qui aliquid magni existimat nisi solum unum immensum bonum æternum. Et quidquid Deus non est, nihil est et pro nihilo computari debet. Est quippe magna differentia inter sapientiam illuminati et devoti viri, et scientiam litterati, et studiosi Clerici. Multo nobilior est illa doctrina quæ desursum ex divina influentia manat, quam quæ laboriose humano acquiritur ingenio.	2. For this much grace is necessary, which may lift up the soul and raise it above itself. And except a man be lifted up in the spirit, and freed from all creatures, and altogether united to God, whatsoever he knoweth, whatsoever even he hath, it mattereth but little. He who esteemeth anything great save the one only incomprehensible, eternal, good, shall long time be little and lie low. For whatsoever is not God is nothing, and ought to be counted for nothing. Great is the difference between a godly man, illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar learned in knowledge and given to books. Far nobler is that doctrine which floweth down from the divine fulness above, than that which is acquired laboriously by human study.
3. Plures reperiuntur contemplationem, desiderare, sed quæ ad eam requiruntur non student exercere. Est et magnum impedimentum quia in signis et rebus sensibilibus statur, et parum de perfecta mortificatione habetur. Nescio quid est, et quo spiritu ducimur et quid prætendimus qui spirituales dici videmur quod totum laborem et ampliorem sollicitudinem pro transitoriis et vilibus rebus agimus, et de interioribus nostris vix raro plene recollectis sensibus cogitamus.	3. Many are found who desire contemplation, but they do not strive to practice those things which are required thereunto. It is also a great impediment, that much is made of symbols and external signs, and too little of thorough mortification. I know not how it is, and by what spirit we are led, and what we who would be deemed spiritual are aiming at, that we give so great labour and so eager solicitude for transitory and worthless things, and scarcely ever gather our senses together to think at all of our inward condition.
4. Proh dolor, satim post modicam recollectionem foris erumpimus, nec opera nostra destricta examinatione trutinamus. Ubi jacent affectus nostri, non attendimus, et quam impura sint omnia nostra, non deploramus.Omnis quippe caro corruperate viam suam,et ideo sequebatur diluvium magnum. Cum ergo interior affectus noster corruptus sit, necesse est ut actio sequens index carentiæ interioris vigoris corrumpatur. Ex puro corde procedit fructus bonæ vitæ.	4. Ah, me! Forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of doors, and do not subject our actions to a strict examination. Where our affections are set we take no heed, and we weep not that all things belonging to us are so defiled. For because all flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, the great deluge came. Since therefore our inmost affections are very corrupt, it followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt, being the index of a deficient inward strength. Out of a pure heart proceedeth the fruit of good living.
5. Quantum quis fecerit non quæritur, sed ex quanta virtute agit, non tam studiose pensatur. Si fuerit fortis, dives, pulcher, habilis vel bonus scriptor, vel bonus cantor, aut bonus laborator, investigatur; sed quam pauper sit spiritu, quam patiens et mitis, quam devotus et internus, a multis tacetur. Natura exteriora hominis respicit: gratia ad interiora se convertit. Illa frequenter fallitur; ista in Deo sperat, ut non decipiatur.	5. We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue he acted, is not so narrowly considered. We ask if he be strong, rich, handsome, clever, whether he is a good writer, good singer, good workman; but how poor he may be in spirit, how patient and gentle, how devout and meditative, on these things many are silent. Nature looketh upon the outward appearance of a man, grace turneth its thought to the heart. The former frequently judgeth amiss; the latter trusteth in God, that it may not be deceived.
Cap. 32. De abnegatione sui ipsius et abdicatione omnis cupiditatis.	CHAPTER XXXII Of self-denial and the casting away all selfishness
1. Fili, non potes perfecte possidere libertatem nisi totaliter abneges temetipsum. Compediti sunt omnes proprietarii et sui ipsius amatores, cupidi, curiosi, gyrovagi, quærentes semper curiosa et mollia, non quæ Jesu Christi: sed sæpe hoc fingentes et componentes hoc, quod non stabit. Peribit enim totum hoc quod non es ex Deo ortum. Tene breve et consummatum verbum: Dimitte omnia, et invenies omnia: dimitte cupidinem, et invenies requiem. Hoc mente pertracta et cum impleveris, omnia intelligis.	1. “My Son, thou canst not possess perfect liberty unless thou altogether deny thyself. All they are enslaved who are possessors of riches, they who love themselves, the selfish, the curious, the restless; those who ever seek after soft things, and not after the things of Jesus Christ; those who continually plan and devise that which will not stand. For whatsoever cometh not of God shall perish. Hold fast the short and complete saying, ‘Renounce all things, and thou shalt find all things; give up thy lust, and thou shalt find rest.’ Dwell upon this in thy mind, and when thou art full of it, thou shalt understand all things.”
2. Domine, hoc non est opus unius diei, nec ludus parvulorum: immo in hoc brevi conclluditur omnis perfectio Religioforum.	2. O Lord, this is not the work of a day, nor children’s play; verily in this short saying is enclosed all the perfection of the religious.
3. Fili, non debes averti, nec statim dejici audita via perfectorum, sed magis ad sublimiora provocari, et ad minus ad hoc ex desiderio suspirare. Utinam sic tecum esses, et ad hoc pervenisses, ut tui ipsius amator non esses, sed ad nutum meum pure stares, et ejus quem tibi præposui Patris: tunc mihi valde placeres, et tota vita tua cum gaudio et pace transiret. Habes adhuc multa ad relinquendum quæ nisi mihi ex integro resignaveris, non acquires quod postulas. Suadeo tibi emere a me aurum ignitum, ut locuples fias, idest sapientiam cælestem, omnia infima conculacantem. Postpone terrenam sapientiam omnem ac humanam complacentiam et propriam.	3. “My son, thou oughtest not to be turned aside, nor immediately cast down, because thou hast heard the way of the perfect. Rather oughtest thou to be provoked to higher aims, and at the least to long after the desire thereof. Oh that it were so with thee, and that thou hadst come to this, that thou wert not a lover of thine own self, but wert ready always to My nod, and to his whom I have placed over thee as thy father. Then shouldest thou please Me exceedingly, and all thy life should go on in joy and peace. Thou hast still many things to renounce, which if thou resign not utterly to Me, thou shalt not gain what thou seekest. I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, that is heavenly wisdom, which despiseth all base things. Put away from thee earthly wisdom, and all pleasure, whether common to men, or thine own.
4. Dixi tibi viliora emenda pro prætiosis, et altis rebus humanis. Nam vilis et parva, et pene oblivioni tradita videtur vere cælestis sapientia, non sapiens alta de se, nec magnificari quærens in terra. Quam multi ore tenus prædicant, sed vita longe dissentiunt: ipsa tamen est prætiosa margarita multis abscondita.	4. “I tell thee that thou must buy vile things with those which are costly and great in the esteem of men. For wonderfully vile and small, and almost given up to forgetfulness, doth true heavenly wisdom appear, which thinketh not high things of itself, nor seeketh to be magnified upon the earth; many honour it with their lips, but in heart are far from it; it is indeed the precious pearl, which is hidden from many.”
Cap. 33. De instabilitate cordis et de intentione finali ad Deum habenda.	CHAPTER XXXIII Of instability of the heart, and of directing the aim towards God
1.Fili, noli credere affectui tuo, qui nunc est: cito mutabitur in aliud. Quamdiu nam vixeris, mutabilitati subjectus eris, etiam nolens: ut modo lætus, modo tristis, modo pacatus, modo turbatus, nunc devotus, nunc indevotus, nunc studiosus, nunc acidiosus, nunc gravi, nunc levis inveniaris.  Sed stat super hæc mutabilia sapiens et bene doctus in spiritu, non attendens quid in se sentiat nec qua parte flet ventus instabilitatis, sed ut tota intentio mentis ejus ad debitum et ad optimum proficiat finem. Nam sic poterit unus et idem inconcussus manere, simplici intentionis oculo per tot varios eventus ad me imprætermisse directo.	1. “My Son, trust not thy feeling, for that which is now will be quickly changed into somewhat else. As long as thou livest thou art subject to change, howsoever unwilling; so that thou art found now joyful, now sad; now at peace, now disquieted; now devout, now indevout; now studious, now careless; now sad, now cheerful. But the wise man, and he who is truly learned in spirit, standeth above these changeable things, attentive not to what he may feel in himself, or from what quarter the wind may blow, but that the whole intent of his mind may carry him on to the due and much-desired end. For thus will he be able to remain one and the same and unshaken, the single eye of his desire being steadfastly fixed, through the manifold changes of the world, upon Me.
2. Quanto autem purior fuerit intentionis oculus, tanto constantius inter diversas itur procellas. Sed multis caligat oculos puræ intentionis. Respicit enim cito in aliquod delectabile quod occurrit et raro totus quis liber invenitur a nævo propriæ inquisitionis. Sic Judæi olim venerunt Bethaniam ad Martham et Mariam,non propter Jesum tantum, sed ut Lazarum viderent.Mundandus est ergo intentionis oculus, ut sit simplex et rectus atque ultra omnia varia media ad me dirigendus.	2. “But according as the eye of intention be the more pure, even so will a man make his way steadfastly through the manifold storms. But in many the eye of pure intention waxeth dim; for it quickly resteth itself upon anything pleasant which occurreth, and rarely is any man found altogether free from the blemish of self-seeking. So the Jews of old came to Bethany, to the house of Martha and Mary, that they might see not Jesus, but Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. Therefore must the eye of the intention be cleansed, that it may be single and right, and above all things which come in its way, may be directed unto Me.”
Cap. 34. Quod amanti sapit Deus super omnia et in omnibus.	CHAPTER XXXIV That to him who loveth God is sweet above all things and in all things
1. Ecce Deus meus et omnia. Quid volo amplius? Et quid felicius desiderare possum? O, sapidum et dulce verbum,sed amantiverbumnon mundum, nec ea quæ in mundo sunt.Deus meus et omnia. Intelligenti satis dictum est, et sæpe repetere jucundum est amanti. Te siquidem præsente jucunda sunt omnia: te autem absente fastidiunt cuncta. Tu facis cor tranquillum, et pacem magnam, lætitiamque festivam. Tu faci bene sentire de omnibus, et in omnibus te laudare: nec potest aliquid diu sine te placere; sed si debet gratum esse et bene sapere, oportet gratiam tuam adesse, et condimento tuæ sapientiæ condiri.	1. Behold, God is mine, and all things are mine! What will I more, and what more happy thing can I desire? O delightsome and sweet world! that is, to him that loveth the Word, not the world, neither the things that are in the world. My God, my all! To him that understandeth, that word sufficeth, and to repeat it often is pleasing to him that loveth it. When Thou art present all things are pleasant; when Thou art absent, all things are wearisome. Thou makest the heart to be at rest, givest it deep peace and festal joy. Thou makest it to think rightly in every matter, and in every matter to give Thee praise; neither can anything please long without Thee but if it would be pleasant and of sweet savour, Thy grace must be there, and it is Thy wisdom which must give unto it a sweet savour.
2. Cui tu sapis, quid ei recte non sapiet? Et cui tu non sapis, quid ei recte ad jucunditatem esse poterit? Sed deficiunt in tua sapientia mundi sapientes, et qui carnem sapiunt: quia ibi plurima vanitas, et hic mors invenitur. Qui autem te per contemtum mundanorum et carnis mortificationem sequuntur, vere sapientes esse cognoscuntur, quia de vanitate ad veritatem, et de carne ad spiritum transferuntur. Istis sapit Deus, et quidquid invenitur in creaturis totum referunt ad laudem sui Conditoris. Dissimilis tamen est et multum dissimlis sapor Creatoris et creaturæ, æternitatis, et temporis, lucis increatæ et lucis illuminatæ.	2. To him who tasteth Thee, what can be distasteful? And to him who tasteth Thee not, what is there which can make him joyous? But the worldly wise, and they who enjoy the flesh, these fail in Thy wisdom; for in the wisdom of the world is found utter vanity, and to be carnally minded is death. But they who follow after Thee through contempt of worldly things, and mortification of the flesh, are found to be truly wise because they are carried from vanity to verity, from the flesh to the spirit. They taste that the Lord is good, and whatsoever good they find in creatures, they count it all unto the praise of the Creator. Unlike, yea, very unlike is the enjoyment of the Creator to enjoyment of the Creature, the enjoyment of eternity and of time, of light uncreated and of light reflected.
3. O, lux perpetua, cuncta creata transcendens lumina: fulgura coruscationem de sublimi penetrantem omnia intima cordis mei. Purifica, lætifica, clarifica, et vivifica spiritum meum cum suis potentiis ad inhærendum tibi jubilosis successibus. O, quando veniet hæc beata et desiderabilis hora, ut tua me saties præsentia, et sis mihi omnia in omnibus. Quamdiu hoc non datum fuerit, nec gaudium plenum erit. Adhuc, proh dolor, vivit in me vetus homo, non est totus crucifixus, non est perfecte mortuus, adhuc concupiscit fortiter adversus spiritum. Bella movent intestina, nec regnum animæ patitur esse quietum.	3. O Light everlasting, surpassing all created lights, dart down Thy ray from on high which shall pierce the inmost depths of my heart. Give purity, joy, clearness, life to my spirit that with all its powers it may cleave unto Thee with rapture passing man’s understanding. Oh when shall that blessed and longed-for time come when Thou shalt satisfy me with Thy presence, and be unto me All in all? So long as this is delayed, my joy shall not be full. Still, ah me! the old man liveth in me: he is not yet all crucified, not yet quite dead; still he lusteth fiercely against the spirit, wageth inward wars, nor suffereth the soul’s kingdom to be in peace.
4. Sed tu qui dominaris potestati maris, et motum fluctuum ejus tu mitigas, exsurge, adjuva me. Dissipa gentes quæ bella volunt; contere eas in virtute tua. Ostende quæso magnalia tua, et glorificetur dextera tua: quia non est spes alia, nec refugium mihi nisi in te, Domine Deus meus.	4. But Thou who rulest the raging of the sea, and stillest the waves thereof when they arise, rise up and help me. Scatter the people that delight in war. Destroy them by Thy power. Show forth, I beseech Thee, Thy might, and let Thy right hand be glorified, for I have no hope, no refuge, save in Thee, O Lord my God.
Cap. 35. Quod non est securitas a tentatione in hac vita.	CHAPTER XXXV That there is no security against temptation in this life
1. Fili, nunquam es securus in hac vita: sed quoad vixeris, semper arma spiritualia tibi sunt necessaria. Inter hostes versaris; a dextris et a sinistris impugnaris. Si ergo non uteris undique scuto patientiæ, non eris diu sine vulnere. Insuper si non ponis cor tuum fixe in me cum vera voluntate cuncta patiendi propter me, non poteris ardorem istum sustinere, nec ad palmam pertingere Beatorum. Oportet ergo te viriliter omnia pertransire, et potenti manu uti adversus objecta. Nam vincenti datur manna et torpenti relinquitur multa miseria.	1. “My Son, thou art never secure in this life, but thy spiritual armour will always be needful for thee as long as thou livest. Thou dwellest among foes, and art attacked on the right hand and on the left. If therefore thou use not on all sides the shield of patience, thou wilt not remain long unwounded. Above all, if thou keep not thy heart fixed upon Me with steadfast purpose to bear all things for My sake, thou shalt not be able to bear the fierceness of the attack, nor to attain to the victory of the blessed. Therefore must thou struggle bravely all thy life through, and put forth a strong hand against those things which oppose thee. For to him that overcometh is the hidden manna given, but great misery is reserved for the slothful.
2. Si quæris in hac vita requiem: quomodo tunc pervenies ad æternam requiem? Non ponas te ad multam requiem, sed a magnam patientiam. Quære veram pacem non in terris sed in cælis, non in hominibus nec in cæteris creaturis, sed in Deo solo. Pro amore Dei debes omnia libenter subire, labores scilicet et dolores, tentationes et vexationes, anxietates, et necessitates, infirmitates, injurias, oblocutiones, reprehensiones, humiliationes, confusiones, correctiones et despectiones. Ego reddam ei æternam mercedem pro brevi labore, et infinitam gloriam pro transitoria confusione.	2. “If thou seek rest in this life, how then wilt thou attain unto the rest which is eternal? Set not thyself to attain much rest, but much patience. Seek the true peace, not in earth but in heaven, not in man nor in any created thing, but in God alone. For the love of God thou must willingly undergo all things, whether labours or sorrows, temptations, vexations, anxieties, necessities, infirmities, injuries, gainsayings, rebukes, humiliations, confusions, corrections, despisings; these things help unto virtue, these things prove the scholar of Christ; these things fashion the heavenly crown. I will give thee an eternal reward for short labour, and infinite glory for transient shame.
3. Putas, quod semper habebis pro tua voluntate consolationes spirituales. Sancti mei non habuerunt tales, sed multas gravitates et tentationes varia, magnasque desolationes, sed patienter sustinuerunt se in omnibus et magis confisi sunt Deo quam sibi: scientesquia non sunt condignæ passiones hujus temporis ad futuram gloriampromerendam. Vis tu statim habere, quod multi post multas lacrymas et magnos labores vix obtinuerunt? Exspecta Dominum, viriliter age et confortare; noli diffidere, noli discedere, sed corpus et animam expone constanter pro gloria Dei. Ego reddam plenissime; ego tecum ero in omni tribulatione.	3. “Thinkest thou that thou shalt always have spiritual consolations at thy will? My Saints had never such, but instead thereof manifold griefs, and divers temptations, and heavy desolations. But patiently they bore themselves in all, and trusted in God more than in themselves, knowing that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Wouldst thou have that immediately which many have hardly attained unto after many tears and hard labours? Wait for the Lord, quit thyself like a man and be strong; be not faint-hearted, nor go aside from Me, but constantly devote thy body and soul to the glory of God. I will reward thee plenteously, I will be with thee in trouble.”
Cap. 36. Contra hominum vana judicia.	CHAPTER XXXVI Against vain judgments of men
1. Fili, jacta cor tuum firmiter in Domino; et humanum ne metuas judicium, ubi te conscientia pium reddit insontem. Bonum est et beatum taliter pati: nec hoc erit grave humili cordi et Deo magis quam sibi ipsi confidenti. Multi multa loquuntur et ideo parva fides est adhibenda. Sed et omnibus satis esse non est possibile. Et si Paulus studuit omnibus in Domino placere, et omibus omnia factus est, tamen etiam pro minimo duxit, quod ab humano die judicatus fuerit.	1. “My Son, anchor thy soul firmly upon God, and fear not man’s judgment, when conscience pronounceth thee pious and innocent. It is good and blessed thus to suffer; nor will it be grievous to the heart which is humble, and which trusteth in God more than in itself. Many men have many opinions, and therefore little trust is to be placed in them. But moreover it is impossible to please all. Although Paul studied to please all men in the Lord, and to become all things to all men, yet nevertheless with him it was a very small thing that he should be judged by man’s judgment.”
2. Egit satis pro aliorum ædificatione et salute, quantum in se erat, et poterat: sed ne ab aliis aliquando judicaretur, vel non despiceretur, cohibere non potuit. Ideo totum commisit Deo, qui totum noverat; et patientia et humilitate contra ora loquentium iniqua, ac etiam vana et mundana cogitatantiam, atque pro libitu suo quæque jactantium se defendit. Respondit tamen interdum, ne infirmis pro sua taciturnitate generaretur scandalum.	2. He laboured abundantly, as much as in him lay, for the building up and the salvation of others; but he could not avoid being sometimes judged and despised by others. Therefore he committed all to God, who knew all, and by patience and humility defended himself against evil speakers, or foolish and false thinkers, and those who accused him according to their pleasure. Nevertheless, from time to time he replied, lest his silence should become a stumbling-block to those who were weak.
3.Quis es tu, ut timeas a mortali homine?Hodie est, et cras non comparet. Deum time, et hominum pavores non expavesces. Quis potest in te aliquid? Verbis, aut injuriis sibi potius nocet, quam tibi; nec poterit judicium Dei fugere quicumque est ille. Tu habe Deum præ oculis, et noli contendere verbis querolosis. Quod si ad præsens videris succumbi, et confusionem pati quam non meruisti, non indigneris ex hoc neque per impatientiam minuas coronam tuam. Sed ad me potius respice in cælum, qui potens sum eripere ab omni confusione et injuria et unicuique reddere secundum opera sua.	3. “Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die? To-day he is, and to-morrow his place is not found. Fear God and thou shalt not quail before the terrors of men. What can any man do against thee by words or deeds? He hurteth himself more than thee, nor shall he escape the judgment of God, whosoever he may be. Have thou God before thine eyes, and do not contend with fretful words. And if for the present thou seem to give way, and to suffer confusion which thou hast not deserved, be not angry at this, nor by impatience diminish thy reward; but rather look up to Me in heaven, for I am able to deliver thee from all confusion and hurt, and to render to every man according to his works.”
Cap. 37. De pura et integra resignatione cordis ad obtinendam sui libertatem.	CHAPTER XXXVII Of pure and entire resignation of self, for the obtaining liberty of heart
1. Fili, relinque te, et invenies me; sta sine electione, et omni proprietate et semper lucraberis. Nam et adjicietur tibi amplior gratia statim, ut te resignaveris nec resumpseris.	1. “My Son, lose thyself and thou shalt find Me. Stand still without all choosing and all thought of self, and thou shalt ever be a gainer. For more grace shall be added to thee, as soon as thou resignest thyself, and so long as thou dost not turn back to take thyself again.”
2. Domine, quoties me resignabo? et in quibus me relinquam?	2. O Lord, how often shall I resign myself, and in what things shall I lose myself?
3. Semper et in omni hora: sicut in parvo, sic et in magno. Nihil excipio, sed in omnibus te nudatum inveniri volo. Alioquin quomodo poteris esse meus et ego tuus, nisi fueris ab omni propria voluntate intus et foris spoliatus? Quanto celerius hoc agi, tanto melius habebis; et quanto plenius et sincerius, tanto mihi plus placebis, et amplius lucraberis.	3. “Always; every hour: in that which is little, and in that which is great. I make no exception, but will that thou be found naked in all things. Otherwise how canst thou be Mine and I thine, unless thou be inwardly and outwardly free from every will of thine own? The sooner thou dost this, the better shall it be with thee; and the more fully and sincerely, the more thou shalt please Me, and the more abundantly shalt thou be rewarded.
4. Quidam se resignant, sed cum aliqua exceptione: non enim plene in Deo confidunt; ideo providere sibi satagunt. Quidam etiam primo offerunt totum, sed postea tentatione pulsante ad propria redeunt; ideo minime in virtute proficiunt. Hi ad veram puri cordis libertatem, et jucundæ familiaritatis meæ gratiam non pertingent, nisi integra resignatione, et quotidiana sui immolatione prius facta, sine qua non stabit, nec stat unio fruitiva.	4. “Some resign themselves, but with certain reservations, for they do not fully trust in God, therefore they think that they have some provision to make for themselves. Some again at first offer everything; but afterwards being pressed by temptation they return to their own devices, and thus make no progress in virtue. They will not attain to the true liberty of a pure heart, nor to the grace of My sweet companionship, unless they first entirely resign themselves and daily offer themselves up as a sacrifice; without this the union which bringeth forth fruit standeth not nor will stand.
5. Dixi tibi sæpissime et iterum nunc dico: Relinque te, resigna te, et frueris magna interna pace. Da totum pro toto, niihil exquire, nil repete, sta pure et inhæsitanter in me, et habebis me. Eris liber in corde, et tenebræ non conculcabunt te. Ad hoc conare, hoc ora, hoc stude desiderare, ut ab omni proprietate possis exspoliari et nudus nudum Jesum sequi, tibi mori, et mihi æternaliter vivere. Tunc deficient omnes vanæ phantasiæ, conturbationes iniquæ, et curæ superfluæ. Tunc etiam recedet immoderatus timor, et inordinatus amor morietur.	5. “Many a time I have said unto thee, and now say again, Give thyself up, resign thyself, and thou shalt have great inward peace. Give all for all; demand nothing, ask nothing in return; stand simply and with no hesitation in Me, and thou shalt possess Me. Thou shalt have liberty of heart, and the darkness shall not overwhelm thee. For this strive thou, pray for it, long after it, that thou mayest be delivered from all possession of thyself, and nakedly follow Jesus who was made naked for thee; mayest die unto thyself and live eternally to Me. Then shall all vain fancies disappear, all evil disturbings, and superfluous cares. Then also shall immoderate fear depart from thee, and inordinate love shall die.”
Cap. 38. De bono regimine in externis, et recursu ad Deum in periculis.	CHAPTER XXXVIII Of a good government in external things, and of having recourse to God in dangers
1. Fili, ad istud diligenter tendere debes, ut in omni loco, actione seu occupatione externa sis intus liber, et tui ipsius potens, et sint omnia sub te, et tu non sub eis, ut sis dominus actionum tuarum, et rector, non servus, nec emptitius, sed magis exemtus verusque Hebræus, in fortem ac libertatem transiens filiorum Dei; qui stant supra præsentia et speculantur æterna; qui transitoria intuentur sinistro oculo, et dextro cælestia, quos temporalia non trahunt ad inhærendum, sed trahunt ipsi ea magis ad bene serviendum, prout ordinata sunt a Deo, et instituta a summo Opifice, qui nil inordinatum reliquit in sua creatura.	1. “My Son, for this thou must diligently make thy endeavour, that in every place and outward action or occupation thou mayest be free within, and have power over thyself; and that all things be under thee, not thou under them; that thou be master and ruler of thy actions, not a slave or hireling, but rather a free and true Hebrew, entering into the lot and the liberty of the children of God, who stand above the present and look upon the eternal, who with the left eye behold things transitory, and with the right things heavenly; whom temporal things draw not to cleave unto, but who rather draw temporal things to do them good service, even as they were ordained of God to do, and appointed by the Master Workman, who hath left nought in His creation without aim and end.
2. Si autem in omni eventu stas non in apparentia externa, nec oculo carnali lustras visa vel audita, sed mox in qualibet causa intras cum Moyse in tabernaculum ad consulendum Dominum: et audies nonnunquam divinum responsum et redies instructus de multis præsentibus et futuris. Semper enim Moyses recursum habuit ad tabernaculum pro dubiis et quæstionibus solvendis fugitque ad oratiois adjutorium pro periculis et improbitatibus hominum sublevandis. Sic et tu confugere debes in cordis tui secretarium divinum intentius implorando auxilium. Propterea namque Josue, et filii Israel a Gabaonitis leguntur decepti, quia os Domini non prius interrogaverunt, sed nimium creduli dulcibus sermonibus falsa pietate delusi sunt.	2. “And if in any chance of life thou stand not in outward appearances, nor judgest things which are seen and heard by the fleshly sense, but straightway in every cause enterest with Moses into the tabernacle to ask counsel of God; thou shalt hear a divine response and come forth instructed concerning many things that are and shall be. For always Moses had recourse to the tabernacle for the solving of all doubts and questionings; and fled to the help of prayer to be delivered from the dangers and evil deeds of men. Thus also oughtest thou to fly to the secret chamber of thy heart, and earnestly implore the divine succour. For this cause we read that Joshua and the children of Israel were deceived by the Gibeonites, that they asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord, but being too ready to listen to fair speeches, were deceived by pretended piety.”
Cap. 39. Quod non sit importunus in negociis.	CHAPTER XXXIX That man must not be immersed in business
1. Fili, committe mihi semper causam tuam, ego bene disponam in tempore suo. Exspecta ordinationem meam et senties exinde profectum.	1. “My Son, always commit thy cause to Me; I will dispose it aright in due time. Wait for My arrangement of it, and then thou shalt find it for thy profit.”
2. Domine, satis libenter omnes res tibi committo, quia parum potest cogitatio mea proficere. Utinam non multum adhærerem futuris eventibus, sed ad beneplacitum tuum me incunctanter offerrem.	2. O Lord, right freely I commit all things to Thee; for my planning can profit but little. Oh that I did not dwell so much on future events, but could offer myself altogether to Thy pleasures without delay.
3. Fili mi, sæpe homo rem aliquam agitat, quam desiderat: sed cum ad eam pervenerit, aliter incipit sentire, quia affectiones circa idem non sunt durabiles, sed magis de uno vel in aliud nos impellunt. Non est ergo minimum etiam in minimis se relinquere.	3. “My Son, a man often striveth vehemently after somewhat which he desireth; but when he hath obtained it he beginneth to be of another mind, because his affections towards it are not lasting, but rather rush on from one thing to another. Therefore it is not really a small thing, when in small things we resist self.”
4. Verus profectus hominis est abnegatio sui ipsius, et homo abnegatus valde liber est et securus. Sed antiquus hosti, omnibus bonis adversans, a tentatione non cessat, et die noctuque graves molitur insidias, si forte in laqueum deceptionis possit præcipitare incautum.Vigilate et orate,dicit Dominus,ut non intretis in tentationem.	4. The true progress of man lieth in self-denial, and a man who denieth himself is free and safe. But the old enemy, opposer of all good things, ceaseth not from temptation; but day and night setteth his wicked snares, if haply he may be able to entrap the unwary. Watch and pray, saith the Lord, lest ye enter into temptation.
Cap. 40. Quod homo nihil boni ex se habet, et de nullo gloriari debet.	CHAPTER XL That man hath no good in himself, and nothing whereof to glory
1.Domine, quid est homo, quod memor sis ejus, aut filius hominis, quia visitas eum?Quid promeruit homo, ut dares illi gratiam tuam? Domine, quid possum conqueri, si deseris me? aud quid juste obtendere possum, si quod peto non feceris? Certe hoc in veritate cogitare possum et dicere: Domine, nihil sum; nihil boni ex me habeo, sed in omnibus deficio, et ad nihil semper tendo. Ego nisi a te fuero adjutus et interius informatus, totus efficior tepidus et dissolutus.	1. Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him? What hath man deserved, that Thou shouldest bestow thy favour upon him? Lord, what cause can I have of complaint, if Thou forsake me? Or what can I justly allege, if Thou refuse to hear my petition? Of a truth, this I may truly think and say, Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing that is good of myself, but I fall short in all things, and ever tend unto nothing. And unless I am helped by Thee and inwardly supported, I become altogether lukewarm and reckless.
2. Tu autem, Domine, semper idem ipse es, et permanes in æternum: semper bonus et justus et sanctus; bene, juste et sancte agens omnia et disponens in sapientia. Sed ego, qui ad defectum magis pronus sum quam ad profectum, non semper sum in uno statu perdurans, quia septem tempora mutantur super me. Verumtamen cito melius sit, cum tibi placuerit, et manum porrexeris adjutricem: quia tu solus sine humano suffragio poteris auxiliari et in tantum confirmare, ut vultus meus amplius in diversa non mutetur, sed in te uno cor meum convertatur et quiescat.	2. But Thou, O Lord, art always the same, and endurest for ever, always good, righteous, and holy; doing all things well, righteously, and holily, and disposing all in Thy wisdom. But I who am more ready to go forward than backward, never continue in one stay, because changes sevenfold pass over me. Yet it quickly becometh better when it so pleaseth Thee, and Thou puttest forth Thy hand to help me; because Thou alone canst aid without help of man, and canst so strengthen me that my countenance shall be no more changed, but my heart shall be turned to Thee, and rest in Thee alone.
3. Unde si bene scirem omnem humanam consolationem abjicere, sive propter devotionem adipiscendam, sive propter necessitatem qua compellor te quærere, quia non est homo qui me consoletur: tunc merito possem de gratia sperare tua, et de dono novæ consolationis exultare.	3. Wherefore, if I but knew well how to reject all human consolations, whether for the sake of gaining devotion, or because of the necessity by which I was compelled to seek Thee, seeing there is no man who can comfort me; then could I worthily trust in Thy grace, and rejoice in the gift of new consolation.
4. Gratias tibi, unde totum venit quotiescumque mihi bene succedit. Ego autem vanitas, et nihilum ante te, inconstans homo et infirmus. Unde possum gloriari? aut cur appeto reputari? Numquid de nihilo? et hoc vanissimum est. Vere inanis gloria pestis mala, vanitas maxima, quia a vera trahit gloria, et cælesti spoliat gratia. Dum enim homo complacet sibi, displicet tibi; dum inhiat laudibus humanis, privatur veris virtutibus.	4. Thanks be to Thee, from whom all cometh, whensoever it goeth well with me! But I am vanity and nothing in Thy sight, a man inconstant and weak. What then have I whereof to glory, or why do I long to be held in honour? Is it not for nought? This also is utterly vain. Verily vain glory is an evil plague, the greatest of vanities, because it draweth us away from the true glory, and robbeth us of heavenly grace. For whilst a man pleaseth himself he displeaseth Thee; whilst he gapeth after the praises of man, he is deprived of true virtues.
5. Est autem vera gloria et exultatio sancta gloriari in te et non in se, gaudere in nomine tuo, non in virtute propria, nec in aliqua creatura delectari nisi propter te. Laudetur nomen tuum, non meum; magnificetur opus tuum, non meum; benedicatur nomen sanctum tuum, non meum; nihil autem attribuatur mihi de laudibus hominum. Tu gloria mea, tu exaltatio cordis mei. In te gloriabor et exultabo tota die;pro me autem nihil, nisi in infirmatibus meis.	5. But true glory and holy rejoicing lieth in glorying in Thee and not in self; in rejoicing in Thy Name, not in our own virtue; in not taking delight in any creature, save only for Thy sake. Let thy Name, not mine be praised; let Thy work, not mine be magnified; let Thy holy Name be blessed, but to me let nought be given of the praises of men. Thou art my glory, Thou art the joy of my heart. In Thee will I make my boast and be glad all the day long, but for myself let me not glory save only in my infirmities.
6. Quærant Judæi gloriam quæ ab invicem est: ego hanc requiram quæ a solo Deo est. Omnis quidem gloria humana, omnis honor temporalis, omnis altitudo mundana æternæ gloriæ tuæ comparata vanitas est et stultitia. O, veritas mea, et misericordia mea Deus meus, Trinitas beata: tibi soli laus, vertus, honor et gloria per infinita sæculorum sæcula.	6. Let the Jews seek the honour which cometh from one another; but I will ask for that which cometh from God only. Truly all human glory, all temporal honour, all worldly exultation, compared to Thy eternal glory, is but vanity and folly. O God my Truth and my Mercy, Blessed Trinity, to Thee alone be all praise, honour, power, and glory for ever and for ever.
Cap. 41. De contemtu omnis honoris temporalis.	CHAPTER XLI Of contempt of all temporal honour
1. Fili, noli tibi attrahere, si videas alios honorari et elevari, te autem despici et humiliari. Erige cor tuum ad me in cælum et non contristabit te contemtus hominis in terris.	1. “My Son, make it no matter of thine, if thou see others honoured and exalted, and thyself despised and humbled. Lift up thine heart to Me in heaven, and then the contempt of men upon earth will not make thee sad.”
2. Domine, in cæcitate sumus et vanitate cito seducimur. Si recte me inspicio, nunquam facta mihi est injuria ab aliqua creatura: unde nec juste habeo conqueri adversum te: quia autem frequenter et graviter peccavi tibi, merito armatur contra me omnis creatura. Mihi igitur juste debetur confusio, et contemtus: tibi autem laus, honor, virtus et gloria. Et nisi ad hoc me præparavero, quod velim libenter ab omni creatura despici et relinqui, atque penitus nihil videri, non possum interius pacificari et stabiliri nec spiritualiter illuminari, neque tibi plene uniri.	2. O Lord, we are in blindness, and are quickly seduced by vanity. If I look rightly within myself, never was injury done unto me by any creature, and therefore I have nought whereof to complain before Thee. But because I have many times and grievously sinned against Thee, all creatures do justly take arms against me. Therefore to me confusion and contempt are justly due, but to Thee praise and honour and glory. And except I dispose myself for this, namely, to be willing that every creature should despise and desert me, and that I should be esteemed altogether as nothing, I cannot be inwardly filled with peace and strength, nor spiritually enlightened, nor fully united to Thee.
Cap. 42. Quod pax non est ponenda in hominibus.	CHAPTER XLII That our peace is not to be placed in men
1. Fili, si ponis pacem tuam cum aliqua persona propter tuum sentire vel convivere, instabilis eris et implacatus. Sed si recursum habes ad semper viventem et manentem veritatem, non contristabit te amicus recedens aut moriens. In me debet amici dilectio stare, et propter me diligendus est quisquis tibi bonus visus est, et multum carus in hac vita. Sine me non valet, nec durabit amicitia; nec est verba et munda dilectio, quam ego non copulo. Ita mortuus esse debes talibus affectionibus dilectorum hominum, ut quantum ad te pertinet sine humano optes esse consortio. Tanto homo magis Deo appropinquat, quanto ab omni solatio terreno longius recedit. Tanto etiam altius ascendit ad Deum, quanto profundius in se descendit, et plus sibi ipsi vilescit.	1. “My Son, if thou set thy peace on any person because thou hast high opinion of him, and art familiar with him, thou shalt be unstable and entangled. But if thou betake thyself to the ever-living and abiding Truth, the desertion or death of a friend shall not make thee sad. In Me ought the love of thy friend to subsist, and for My sake is every one to be loved, whosoever he be, who appeareth to thee good, and is very dear to thee in this life. Without Me friendship hath no strength or endurance, neither is that love true and pure, which I unite not. Thou oughtest to be so dead to such affections of beloved friends, that as far as in thee lieth, thou wouldst rather choose to be without any companionship of men. The nearer a man approacheth to God, the further he recedeth from all earthly solace. The deeper also he descendeth into himself, and the viler he appeareth in his own eyes, the higher he ascendeth towards God.
2. Qui autem aliquid boni sibi attribuit, gratiam Dei in se invenire impedit: quia gratia Spiritus sancti cor humile quærit semper. Si scires te perfecte annihilare, atque ab omni creato amore evacurare, tunc deberem in te cum magna gratia emanare. Quando tu respicis ad creaturas, subtrahitur tibi aspectus Creatoris. Disce te in omnibus propter Creatoriem vincere: tunc ad divinam valebis cognitionem pertingere. Quantumcumque modicum sit, si quid inordinate diligitur et respicitur, retardat a summo bono, et vitiat.	2. “But he who attributeth anything good to himself, hindereth the grace of God from coming to him, because the grace of the Holy Ghost ever seeketh the humble heart. If thou couldst make thyself utterly nothing, and empty thyself of the love of every creature, then should it be My part to overflow unto thee with great grace. When thou settest thine eyes upon creatures, the face of the Creator is withdrawn from thee. Learn in all things to conquer thyself for thy Creator’s sake, then shalt thou be able to attain unto divine knowledge. How small soever anything be, if it be loved and regarded inordinately, it holdeth us back from the highest good, and corrupteth.”
Cap. 43. Contra vanam, et sæcularem scientiam.	CHAPTER XLIII Against vain and worldly knowledge
1. Fili, non moveant te pulchra et subtilia dicta hominum:non est enim regnum Dei in sermone, sed in virtute.Attende verba mea quæ cordo accendunt et mentes illuminant, inducunt compunctionem, et variam ingerunt consolationem. Nunquam ad hoc legas verbum, ut doctior aut sapientior possis videri; sed stude mortificationem vitiorum, quia hoc amplius tibi proderit, quam notitia multarum difficilium quæstionum.	1. “My Son, let not the fair and subtle sayings of men move thee. For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. Give ear to My words, for they kindle the heart and enlighten the mind, they bring contrition, and they supply manifold consolations. Never read thou the word that thou mayest appear more learned or wise; but study for the mortification of thy sins, for this will be far more profitable for thee than the knowledge of many difficult questions.
2. Cum multa legeris et cognoveris, ad unum oportet te venire principium. Ego sum qui doceo hominem scientiam et clariorem intelligentiam parvulis tribuo quam ab homine possit doceri. Cui ego loquar, cito sapiens erit et multum in spiritu proficiet. Væ illis qui multa curiosa ab hominibus quærunt, et de via mihi serviendi parum curant. Veniet tempus quando apparebit Magister magistrorum Christus, Dominus Angelorum, cunctorum auditurus lectiones, et singulorum examinaturus conscientias, et tuncscrutabitur Hierusalem in lucerniset manifesta erunt abscondita tenebrarum, tacebuntque argumenta linguarum.	2. “When thou hast read and learned many things, thou must always return to one first principle. I am He that teacheth man knowledge, and I give unto babes clearer knowledge than can be taught by man. He to whom I speak will be quickly wise and shall grow much in the spirit. Woe unto them who inquire into many curious questions from men, and take little heed concerning the way of My service. The time will come when Christ will appear, the Master of masters, the Lord of the Angels, to hear the lessons of all, that is to examine the consciences of each one. And then will He search Jerusalem with candles, and the hidden things of darkness shall be made manifest, and the arguings of tongues shall be silent.
3. Ego sum qui humilem in puncto elevo mentem, ut plures æternæ veritatis capiat rationes quam si quis decem annis studuisset in scholis. Ego doceo sine strepitu verborum, sine confusione opinionum, sine fastu honoris, sine pugnatione argumentorum. Ego sum qui doceo terrena despicere, præsentia fastidire, æterna quærere, æterna sapere, honores fugere, scandala sufferre, omnem spem in me ponere, extra me nihil cupere, et super omnia ardenter me amare.	3. “I am He who in an instant lift up the humble spirit, to learn more reasonings of the Eternal Truth, than if a man had studied ten years in the schools. I teach without noise of words, without confusion of opinions, without striving after honour, without clash of arguments. I am He who teach men to despise earthly things, to loathe things present, to seek things heavenly, to enjoy things eternal, to flee honours, to endure offences, to place all hope in Me, to desire nothing apart from Me, and above all things to love Me ardently.
4. Nam quidam amando me intime, didicit divina, et loquebatur mirabilia. Plus profecit in relinquendo omnia, quam in studendo subtilia. Sed loquor communia aliis, aliis specialia, aliquibus in signis et figuris dulciter appareo; quibusdam vero in lumine, multa revelo mysteria. Una vox librorum, sed non æque omnes informat, quia intus sum doctor veritatis, cordis scrutator, cognitationum intellector, actionum promotor, distribuens singulis sicut dignum judicavero.	4. “For there was one, who by loving Me from the bottom of his heart, learned divine things, and spake things that were wonderful; he profited more by forsaking all things than by studying subtleties. But to some I speak common things, to others special; to some I appear gently in signs and figures, and again to some I reveal mysteries in much light. The voice of books is one, but it informeth not all alike; because I inwardly am the Teacher of truth, the Searcher of the heart, the Discerner of the thoughts, the Mover of actions, distributing to each man, as I judge meet.”
Cap. 44. De non attrahendo res exteriores.	CHAPTER XLIV Of not troubling ourselves about outward things
1. Fili, oportet te in multis esse inscium et æstimare te tamquam mortuum super terram et cui mundus totus crucifixus sit. Multa etiam oportet surda aure pertransire et quæ tuæ pacis sunt magis cogitare. Utilius est oculos a rebus displicentibus avertere, et unicuique suum sentire relinquere, quam contentiosis sermonibus deservire. Si bene steteris cum Deo, et ejus judicium aspexeris facilius te victum portabis.	1. “My Son, in many things it behoveth thee to be ignorant, and to esteem thyself as one dead upon the earth, and as one to whom the whole world is crucified. Many things also thou must pass by with deaf ear, and must rather think upon those things which belong unto thy peace. It is more profitable to turn away thine eyes from those things that displease, and to leave each man to his own opinion, than to give thyself to discourses of strife. If thou stand well with God and hast His judgment in thy mind, thou wilt verily easily bear to be as one conquered.”
2. O, Domine, quousque venimus? Ecce damnum defletur temporale: pro modico quæstu laboratur et curritur et spirituale detrimentum in oblivionem transit, et vix sero reditur. Quod parum vel nihil prodest, attenditur et quod summe necessarium est, negligenter præteritur, quia totus homo ad externa defluit, et nisi cito resipiscat, libens in exterioribus jacet.	2. O Lord, to what have we come? Behold a temporal loss is mourned over; for a trifling gain we labour and hurry; and spiritual loss passeth away into forgetfulness, and we rarely recover it. That which profiteth little or nothing is looked after, and that which is altogether necessary is negligently passed by; because the whole man slideth away to outward things, and unless he quickly recovereth himself in outward things he willingly lieth down.
Cap. 45. Quod omnibus non est credendum, et de facili lapsu verborum.	 CHAPTER XLV That we must not believe everyone, and that we are prone to fall in our words
1.Da mihi auxilium, Domine, de tribulatione, quia vana salus hominis.Quam sæpe ibi non inveni fidem, ubi me habere putavi: quoties etiam libi reperi, ubi minus præsumsi. Vana ergo spes in hominibus, salus autem justorum in te, Deus. Benedictus sis, Domine Deus, in omnibus quæ nobis accidunt. Infirmi sumus et instabiles; cito fallimur et permutamur.	1. Lord, be thou my help in trouble, for vain is the help of man. How often have I failed to find faithfulness, where I thought I possessed it. How many times I have found it where I least expected. Vain therefore is hope in men, but the salvation of the just, O God, is in Thee. Blessed be thou, O Lord my God, in all things which happen unto us. We are weak and unstable, we are quickly deceived and quite changed.
2. Quis est homo qui ita caute et circumspecte in omnibus se custodire valeat: ut aliquando in aliquam deceptionem, vel perplexitatem non veniat. Sed qui in te, Domine, confidit, ac simplici ex corde quærit, non tam facile labitur. Et si inciderit in aliquam tribulationem, quomodocumque etiam fuerit implicatus, citius per te eruetur, aut a te consolabitur, quia tu non deseris in te sperantem usque in finem. Rarus fidus amicus, in cunctis amici perseverans pressuris. Tu Domine, tu solus es fidelissimus in omnibus, et præter te non est alter talis.	2. Who is the man who is able to keep himself so warily and circumspectly as not sometimes to come into some snare of perplexity? But he who trusteth in Thee, O Lord, and seeketh Thee with an unfeigned heart, doth not so easily slip. And if he fall into any tribulation, howsoever he may be entangled, yet very quickly he shall be delivered through Thee, or by Thee shall be comforted, because Thou wilt not forsake him that trusteth in Thee unto the end. A friend who continueth faithful in all the distresses of his friend is rare to be found. Thou, O Lord, Thou alone art most faithful in all things, and there is none other like unto Thee.
3. O, quam bene sapuit illa anima sancta, quæ dixit: Mens mea solidata est, et in Christo fundata. Si ita mecum foret, non tam facile timor humanus me sollicitaret, nec verborum jacula moverent. Quis omnia prævidere, quis præcavere futura mala sufficit? Si prævisa etiam lædunt sæpe, quid improvisa nisi graviter feriunt? Sed quare mihi mesero non melius providi? Cur etiam tam facile aliis credidi? Sed homines sumus, nec aliud quam fragiles homines sumus, etsi Angeli a multus æstimamur, et dicimur. Cui credam, Domine? Cui credam nisi tibi? Es veritas quænon fallis, nec falli potes. Et rursum: Omnis homo mendax, instabilis, et labilis maxime in verbis, ita ut statim vix credit debeat, quod rectum in facie sonare videtur.	3. Oh, how truly wise was that holy soul which said, “My mind is steadfastly fixed, and it is grounded in Christ.” If thus it were with me, the fear of man should not so easily tempt me, nor the arrows of words move me. Who is sufficient to foresee all things, who to guard beforehand against future ills? If even things which are foreseen sometimes hurt us, what can things which are not foreseen do, but grievously injure? But wherefore have I not better provided for myself, miserable that I am? Why, too, have I given such heed to others? But we are men, nor are we other than frail men, even though by many we are reckoned and called angels. Whom shall I trust, O Lord, whom shall I trust but Thee? Thou art the Truth, and deceivest not, nor canst be deceived. And on the other hand, Every man is a liar, weak, unstable and frail, especially in his words, so that one ought scarcely ever to believe what seemeth to sound right on the face of it.
4. Quam prudenter præmonuisti,cavendum ab hominibus esse, et quia inimici hominis domestici ejus,nec credendum, si quis dixerit:Ecce hic, aut ecce illic.Doctus sum damno et utinam ad cautelam majorem, non ad insipientiam mihi. Cautus esto, quidam ait; cautus esto, serva apud te quod dico: et dum ego sileo et absconditum credo, nec ille silere potest, quod silendum petiit; sed statim prodit me, et se, et abit. Ab hujusmodi rabulis et incautis hominibus protege me, Domine, ne in manus eorum incideam, nec unquam talia committam. Verbum verum, et stabile da in os meum et linguam calidam longe fac a me. Quod pati nolo, omnimodo cavere debeo.	4. With what wisdom hast thou warned us beforehand to beware of men, and that a man’s foes are they of his own household, and that we must not believe if one say unto us Lo here, or Lo there. I have been taught by my loss, and O that I may prove more careful and not foolish hereby. “Be cautious,” saith some one: “be cautious, keep unto thyself what I tell thee.” And whilst I am silent and believe that it is hid with me, he himself cannot keep silence concerning it, but straightway betrayeth me and himself, and goeth his way. Protect me, O Lord, from such mischief-making and reckless men; let me not fall into their hands, nor ever do such things myself. Put a true and steadfast word into my mouth, and remove a deceitful tongue far from me. What I would not suffer, I ought by all means to beware of doing.
5. O, quam bonum et pacificum de aliis silere, nec indifferenter omnia credere, nec de facili ulterius effari, paucis seipsum revelare, te semper inspectorem cordis quærere, nec omni verborum vento circumferri, sed omnia intima et externa secundum tuæ beneplacitum voluntatis optare perfici. Quam tutum pro conservatione cælestis gratiæ, humanam fugere apparentiam nec appetere quæ foris admirationem videntur præbere: sed ea tota sedulitate sectari, quæ vitæ emendtionem dant, et servorem. Quam multis nocuit virtus scita, ac proprie laudata. Quam sane profuit gratia servata silentio in hac fragili vita, quæ tota tentatio fertur et militia.	5. Oh, how good and peacemaking a thing it is to be silent concerning others, and not carelessly to believe all reports, nor to hand them on further; how good also to lay one’s self open to few, to seek ever to have Thee as the beholder of the heart; not to be carried about with every wind of words, but to desire that all things inward and outward be done according to the good pleasure of Thy will! How safe for the preserving of heavenly grace to fly from human approval, and not to long after the things which seem to win admiration abroad, but to follow with all earnestness those things which bring amendment of life and heavenly fervour! How many have been injured by their virtue being made known and too hastily praised. How truly profitable hath been grace preserved in silence in this frail life, which, as we are told, is all temptation and warfare.
Cap. 46. De confidentia in Deo habenda, quando insurgunt verborum jacula.	CHAPTER XLVI Of having confidence in God when evil words are cast at us
1. Fili, sta firmiter et spera in me. Quid enim sunt verba, nisi verba? per aerem volant, sed lapidem non lædunt. Si reus es, cogita, quod libenter velis emendare. Si nihil tibi conscius es, pensa: pensa quod velis libenter pro Deo hoc sustinere. Parum satis est ut vel verba interdum sustineas, qui necdum fortia verbera tolerare vales. Et quare tam parva tibi ad cor transeunt: nisi quia adhuc carnalis es, et homines magis, quam oportet, attendis? Nam quia despici metuis, reprehendi pro excessibus non vis, et excusationum quæris umbracula.	1. “My Son, stand fast and believe in Me. For what are words but words? They fly through the air, but they bruise no stone. If thou are guilty, think how thou wouldst gladly amend thyself; if thou knowest nothing against thyself, consider that thou wilt gladly bear this for God’s sake. It is little enough that thou sometimes hast to bear hard words, for thou art not yet able to bear hard blows. And wherefore do such trivial matters go to thine heart, except that thou art yet carnal, and regardest men more than thou oughtest? For because thou fearest to be despised, thou art unwilling to be reproved for thy faults, and seekest paltry shelters of excuses.
2. Sed inspice te melius, et cognosces quia vivit adhuc in te mundus, et vanus amor placendi hominibus. Cum enim bassari refugis, et confundi etiam pro defectibus, constat utique, quod nec verus humilis sis, nec vere mundo mortuus, nec tibi mundus crucifixus. Sed audi verba mea, et non curabis decem millia hominum verba. Ecce, si cuncta contra te dicerentur quæ fingi malitionsissime possunt, quid tibi noceret, si omnino transire permitteres, nec plus, quam festucam perpenderes? Numquid vel unum capillum tibi etrahere possent?	2. “But look better into thyself, and thou shalt know that the world is still alive in thee, and the vain love of pleasing men. For when thou fleest away from being abased and confounded for thy faults, it is plain that thou art neither truly humble nor truly dead to the world, and that the world is not crucified to thee. But hearken to My word, and thou shalt not care for ten thousand words of men. Behold, if all things could be said against thee which the utmost malice could invent, what should it hurt thee if thou wert altogether to let it go, and make no more account of it than of a mote? Could it pluck out a single hair of thy head?
3. Sed qui cor intus non habent, nec Deum præ ocuis, facile faciliterque verbo moventur vituperationis. Qui autem in me confidit, nec proprio judicio stare appetit, absque humano terrore erit. Ego sum enim judex, et cognitor omnium secretorum; Ego scio, qualiter res acta est; Ego injuriantem novi, et sustinentem. A me exiit verbum istud; me permittente hoc accidit,ut revelentur ex multis cordibus cogitationes.Ego reum et innocentem judicabo; sed utrumque occulto judicio volui probare ante.	3. “But he that hath no heart within him, and hath not God before his eyes, is easily moved by a word of reproach; but he who trusteth in Me, and seeketh not to abide by his own judgment, shall be free from the fear of men. For I am the Judge and the Discerner of all secrets; I know how the thing hath been done; I know both the injurer and the bearer. From Me went forth that word, by My permission this hath happened, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. I shall judge the guilty and the innocent; but beforehand I have willed to try them both by a secret judgment.
4. Testimonium hominum sæpe salit; meum judicium verum est, stabit et non subvertetur. Latet plerumque, et paucis ad singula patet; numquam tamen errat, nec errare potest, etiamsi oculis insipientium non rectum videatur. Ad me ergo recurrendum est in omni judicio, nec proprio innitendum arbitrio;justusenimnon conturbabitur, quidquid a Deo ei acciderit.Et si injuste aliquid contra eum prolatum fuerit, non multum curabit; sed nec vane exultabit, si per alios rationabiliter excusetur. Pensat namque quia ego sumscrutans corda et renes;qui non judico secundum faciem et humanam apparentiam. Nam sæpe etiam oculis meis reperitur culpabile, quod hominum judicio creditur laudabile.	4. “The testimony of men often deceiveth. My judgment is true; it will stand, and it shall not be overturned. It commonly lieth hid, and only to few in certain cases is it made known; yet it never erreth, nor can err, although it seem not right to the eyes of foolish men. To Me, therefore, must men have recourse in all judgment, and must not lean to their opinion. For there shall no evil happen to the just, whatsoever may be sent to him by God. Even though some unjust charge be brought against him, he will care little; nor, again, will he exult above measure, if through others he be clearly vindicated. For he considereth that I am He who try the hearts and reins, who judge not outwardly and according to human appearance; for often in Mine eyes that is found blameworthy which in the judgment of men is held worthy of praise.”
5. Domine Deus, judex juste, fortis et patiens, qui hominum nosti fragilitatem et pravitatem, esto robur meum, et tota fiducia mea; non enim mihi sufficit conscientia mea. Tu nosti, quod ego non novi, et ideo in omni reprehensione me humiliare debui, et mansuete sustinere. Ignosce ergo mihi propitius, quoties sic non egi; et dona iterum gratiam amplioris sufferentiæ. Melior est enim mihi tua copiosa misericordia ad consecutionem indulgentiæ, quam mea opinata justitia pro defensione latentis conscientiæ.Et si mihi nihil conscius sum, tamen in hoc justificare me non possum: quiaremota misericordia tuanon justificabitur in conspectu tuo omnis vivens.	5. O Lord God, O Judge, just, strong, and patient, who knowest the frailty and sinfulness of men, be Thou my strength and my whole confidence; for my own conscience sufficeth me not. Thou knowest what I know not; and therefore ought I under all rebuke to humble myself, and to bear it meekly. Therefore mercifully forgive me as often as I have not done this, and grant me the next time the grace of greater endurance. For better unto me is Thine abundant pity for the attainment of Thy pardon, than the righteousness which I believe myself to have for defence against my conscience, which lieth wait against me. Although I know nothing against myself, yet I am not hereby justified, because if Thy mercy were removed away, in Thy sight should no man living be justified.
Cap. 47. Quod omnia gravia pro æterna vita sunt toleranda.	CHAPTER XLVII That all troubles are to be endured for the sake of eternal life
1. Fili, non frangant te labores quos assumsisti propter me, nec tribulationes te dejiciant usquequaque; sed mea promissio in omni eventu te roboret, et consoletur. Ego sufficiens sum ad reddendum supra omnem modum et mensuram. Non hic diu laborabis, nec semper gravaberis doloribus. Exspecta paulisper, et videbis celerem finem malorum. Veniet una hora, quando cessabit omnis labor et tumultus. Modicum est, et breve omne, quod transit cum tempore.	1. “My Son, let not the labours which thou hast undertaken for Me break thee down, nor let tribulations cast thee down in any wise, but let my promise strengthen and comfort thee in every event. I am sufficient to reward thee above all measure and extent. Not long shalt thou labour here, nor always be weighed down with sorrows. Wait yet a little while, and thou shalt see a speedy end of thine evils. An hour shall come when all labour and confusion shall cease. Little and short is all that passeth away with time.
2. Age quod agis; fideliter labora in vinea mea, ego ero merces tua. Scribe, lege, canta, geme, tace, ora, sustine viriliter contraria: digna est his omnibus et majoribus præliis vita æterna. Veniet pax in die una, quæ nota est Domino. Non enim erit dies vel nox hujus scilicet temporis, sed lux perpetua, claritas infinita, pax firma et requies secura. Non dices tunc:Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis hujus?Nec clamabis:Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est,quoniam præcipitabitur mors, et salus erit indefectiva, anxietas nulla jucunditas beata, societas dulcis et decora.	2. “Do earnestly what thou dost; labour faithfully in My vineyard; I will be thy reward. Write, read, sing, weep, be silent, pray, endure adversities manfully; eternal life is worthy of all these conflicts, yea, and of greater. Peace shall come in one day which is known to the Lord; which shall be neither day nor night, but light eternal, infinite clearness, steadfast peace, and undisturbed rest. Thou shalt not say then, Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? nor cry out, Woe is me, for my sojourning is prolonged , because death will be utterly destroyed, and there shall be salvation which can never fail, no more anxiety, happy delight, sweet and noble society.
3. O, si vidisses Sanctorum in cælo coronas perpetuas, quanta quoque nunc exultant gloria, qui huic mundo olim contemtibiles, et quasi vita ipsa indigni putabantur: profecto statim te humiliares usque ad terram et affectares potius omnibus subesse, quam uni præesse; nec hujus vitæ lætos dies concupisceres, sed magis pro Deo tribulari gauderes, et pro nihilo inter homines computari maximum lucrum duceres.	3. “Oh, if thou sawest the unfading crowns of the Saints in heaven, and with what great glory they now rejoice, who aforetime were reckoned by this world contemptibly and as it were unworthy of life, truly thou wouldst immediately humble thyself even to the earth, and wouldst desire rather to be in subjection to all, than to have authority over one; nor wouldst thou long for pleasant days of this life, but wouldst more rejoice to be afflicted for God’s sake, and wouldst esteem it gain to be counted for nought amongst men.
4. O, si tibi hæc saperent, et profunde ad cor transirent, quomodo auderes vel semel conqueri? Nonne pro vita æterna cuncta laboriosa sunt toleranda? Non est parvum quid lucrari, aut perdere regnum  Dei.  Leva igitur faciem tuam in cælo. Ecce ego et omnes Sancti mei mecum, qui in hoc sæculo magnum habuerunt certamen, modo gaudent modo consolantur modo securi sunt et modo requiescunt, et fine fine in regno Patris mei permanebunt mecum.	4. “Oh, if these things were sweet to thy taste, and moved thee to the bottom of thine heart, how shouldst thou dare even once to complain? Are not all laborious things to be endured for the sake of eternal life? It is no small thing, the losing or gaining the Kingdom of God. Lift up therefore thy face to heaven. Behold, I and all My Saints with Me, who in this world had a hard conflict, now rejoice, are now comforted, are now secure, are now at peace, and shall remain with Me evermore in the Kingdom of My Father.”
Cap. 48. De die æternitatis, et hujus vitæ angustiis.	CHAPTER XLVIII Of the day of eternity and of the straitnesses of this life
1. Supernæ civitatis mansio beatissima. O, dies æternitatis clarissima, quam nox non obscurat, sed summa veritas semper irradiat. Dies semper læta, semper secura et nunquam statum mutans in contraria. O, utinam dies illa illuxisset, et cuncta hæc temporalia finem accepissent. Lucet quidem Sanctis perpetua claritate splendida, sed non nisi a longe per speculum peregrinanatibus in terra.	1. Oh most blessed mansion of the City which is above! Oh most clear day of eternity which the night obscureth not, but the Supreme Truth ever enlighteneth! Day always joyful, always secure and never changing its state into those which are contrary. Oh would that this day might shine forth, and that all these temporal things would come to an end. It shineth indeed upon the Saints, glowing with unending brightness, but only from afar and through a glass, upon those who are pilgrims on the earth.
2. Norunt cæli cives, quam gaudiosa sit illa; gemunt exules filii Evæ quod amara et tædiosa sit ista. Dies hujus temporis parvi et mali, pleni doloribus et angustiis: ubi homo multis peccatis inquinatur, multis passionibus irretitur, multis timoribus stringitur, multis curis distenditur, et multis curiositatibus distrahitur, multis vanitatibus implicatur, multis erroribus circumfunditur, multis laboribus atteritur, multis tentationibus gravatur, deliciis enervatur, egestate cruciatur.	2. The citizens of heaven know how glorious that day is; the exiled sons of Eve groan, because this is bitter and wearisome. The days of this life are few and evil, full of sorrows and straits, where man is defiled with many sins, ensnared with many passions, bound fast with many fears, wearied with many cares, distracted with many questionings, entangled with many vanities, compassed about with many errors, worn away with many labours, weighed down with temptations, enervated by pleasures, tormented by poverty.
3. O, qundo erit finis horum multorum laborum? Quando liberabor a misera servitute vitiorum? Quando memorabor, Domine, tui solius? Quando ad plenum lætabor in te? Quando ero sine omni impedimento in vera libertate, sine omni gravamine mentis, et corporis? Quando erit pax solida, pax imperturbabilis et secura pax intus et foris, pax ab omni parte firma? Jesu bone, quando stabo ad videndum te? Quando contemplabor regni tui gloriam? Quando eris mihi omnia in omnibus? O, quando ero tecum in regno tuo, quod præparasit dilectis tuis ab æterno? Relictus sum pauper et exul in terra hostili, ubi bella quotidiana et infortunia maxima.	3. Oh when shall there be an end of these evils? When shall I be delivered from the wretched slavery of my sins? When shall I be mindful, O Lord, of Thee alone? When shall I rejoice in Thee to the full? When shall I be in true liberty without any impediment, without any burden on mind or body? When shall there be solid peace, peace immovable and secure, peace within and without, peace firm on every side? Blessed Jesus, when shall I stand to behold Thee? When shall I gaze upon the glory of Thy kingdom? When shalt Thou be to me all in all? Oh when shall I be with Thee in Thy Kingdom which Thou hast prepared from the foundation of the world for them that love Thee? I am left destitute, an exile in a hostile land, where are daily wars and grievous misfortunes.
4. Consolare exilium meum, mitiga dolorem meum, quia ad te suspirat omne desiderium meum. Nam onus totum mihi est, quidquid hic mundus offert ad solatium, desidero te intime frui, sed nequeo apprehendere. Opto inhærere cælestibus, sed deprimunt res temporales, et immortificatæ passiones. Mente omnibus rebus superesse opto, carni autem invite subesse cogor. Sic ego infelix homo mecum pugno et factus sum mihimetipsi gravis, dum spiritus sursum, et caro quærit esse deorsum.	4. Console my exile, mitigate my sorrow, for towards Thee all my desire longeth. For all is to me a burden, whatsoever this world offereth for consolation. I yearn to enjoy Thee intimately, but I cannot attain unto it. I long to cleave to heavenly things, but temporal things and unmortified passions press me down. In my mind I would be above all things, but in my flesh I am unwillingly compelled to be beneath them. So, wretched man that I am, I fight with myself, and am made grievous even unto myself, while the spirit seeketh to be above and the flesh to be beneath.
5. O, quid intus patior, dum mente cælestia tracto et mox carnalium tentationum et cogitationum turba occurit oranti.Deus meus, ne elongeris a meneque declines in ira a servo tuo.Fulgura coruscationem tuam et dissipaeas,emitte safittas tuaset conturbentur omnes phantasiæ inimici. Recollige omnes sensus meo ad te; fac me oblivisci omnium mundanorum; da cito abjicere et contemnere phantasmata vitiorum. Succurre mihi, æterna Veritas, ut nulla me moveat vanitas. Adveni, cælestis suavitas, et fugiat a facie tua omnis impuritas. Ignosce quoque mihi, et misericorditer indulge, quoties præter te aliud in oratione revolvo. Confiteor etenim vere, quia valde distracte me habere consuevi. Nam ibi multoties non sum, ubi corporaliter sto, aut sedeo, sed ibi magis sum, ubi cogitationibus feror. Ibi sum, ubi cogitatio mea est; ubi est frequenter cogitatio mea, ibi est id quod amo. Hoc mihi cito occurrit, quod naturaliter delectat aut ex usu placet.	5. Oh how I suffer inwardly, while with the mind I discourse on heavenly things, and presently a crowd of carnal things rusheth upon me whilst I pray. My God, be not Thou far from me, nor depart in wrath from Thy servant. Cast forth Thy lightning and scatter them; send out Thine arrows, and let all delusions of my enemy be confounded. Recall my senses unto Thyself, cause me to forget all worldly things; grant me quickly to cast away and despise the imaginations of sin. Succour me, O Eternal Truth, that no vanity may move me. Come unto me, O Heavenly Sweetness, and let all impurity flee from before Thy face. Pardon me also, and of Thy mercy deal gently with me, whensoever in prayer I think on anything besides Thee; for truly I confess that I am wont to be continually distracted. For often and often, where in the body I stand or sit, there I myself am not; but rather am I there, whither I am borne by my thoughts. Where my thought is, there am I; and there commonly is my thought where that which I love is. That readily occurreth to me, which naturally delighteth, or pleaseth through custom.
6. Unde tu, Veritas æterna, aperte dixisti:Ubi enim est thesaurus tuus, ibi est et cor tuum.Si cælum diligo, libenter de cælestibus penso. Si mundum amo, felicitatibus mundi congaudeo, et de adversitatibus ejus tristor. Si carnem diligo, quæ carnis sunt sæpissime imaginor. Si spiritum amo, de spiritualibus cogitare delector. Quæcumque enim diligo, de his libenter loquor et audio, atque talium imagines mecum ad domum reporto. Sed beatus ille homo qui propter te, Domine, omnibus creaturis abeundi licentiam tribuit, qui naturæ vim facit et concupiscentias carnis fervore spiritus crucifigit, ut serenata conscientia, puram tibi orationem offerat, dignusque sit angelicis interesse choris, omnibus terrenis foris et intus exclusis.	6. Wherefore Thou, who art the Truth, hast plainly said, Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. If I love heaven, I gladly meditate on heavenly things. If I love the world, I rejoice in the delights of the world, and am made sorry by its adversities. If I love the flesh, I am continually imagining the things which belong to the flesh; if I love the spirit, I am delighted by meditating on spiritual things. For whatsoever things I love, on these I readily converse and listen, and carry home with me the images of them. But blessed is that man who for Thy sake, O Lord, is willing to part from all creatures; who doth violence to his fleshly nature and crucifieth the lusts of the flesh by the fervour of his spirit, so that with serene conscience he may offer unto Thee a pure prayer, and be made worthy to enter into the angelic choirs, having shut out from himself, both outwardly and inwardly, all worldly things.
Cap. 49. De desiderio æternæ vitæ, et quanta sint certantibus præmia promissa.	CHAPTER XLIX Of the desire after eternal life, and how great blessings are promised to those who strive
1. Fili mi, cum tibi desiderium æternæ beatitudinis desuper infundi sentis, et de tabernaculo corporis exire concupiscis, ut claritatem meam sine vicissitudinis umbra contemplari possis, dilata cor tuum, et omni desiderio hanc sanctam inspirationem suscipe. Redde amplissimas supernæ bonitati gratias, quæ tecum sic dignanter agit, clementer visitat, ardenter excitat, potenter sublevat, ne proprio pondere ad terrena labaris. Neque enim hoc cogitatu tuo aut conatu accipis, sed sola dignatione supernæ gratiæ et divini respectus, quatenus in virtutibus, et majori humilitate proficias et ad futura certamina te præpares mihique toto cordis affectu adhærere et serventi voluntate studeas deservire.	1. “My Son, when thou feelest the desire of eternal happiness to be poured into thee from above, and longest to depart from the tabernacle of this body, that thou mayest contemplate My glory without shadow of turning, enlarge thine heart, and take in this holy inspiration with all thy desire. Give most hearty thanks to the Supreme Goodness, who dealeth with thee so graciously, visiteth thee so lovingly, stirreth thee up so fervently, raiseth thee so powerfully, lest thou sink down through thine own weight, to earthly things. For not by thine own meditating or striving dost thou receive this gift, but by the sole gracious condescension of Supreme Grace and Divine regard; to the end that thou mayest make progress in virtue and in more humility, and prepare thyself for future conflicts, and cleave unto Me with all the affection of thy heart, and strive to serve Me with fervent will.
2. Fili, sæpe ignis ardet, sed sine fumo flamma non ascendit. Sic et aliquorum desideria ad cælestia flagrant et tamen a tentatione carnalis affectus liberi non sunt. Idcirco nec omnino pure pro honore Dei agunt quod tam desideranter ab eo petunt. Tale est et sæpe desiderium tuum, quod insinuasti fore tam importunum. Non enim est hoc purum et perfectum, quod propria commoditate est infectum.	2. “My Son, often the fire burneth, but the flame ascendeth not without smoke. So also the desires of some men burn towards heavenly things, and yet they are not free from the temptation of carnal affection. Thus therefore they are not acting with an altogether simple desire for God’s glory when they pray to Him so earnestly. Such, too, is oftentimes thy desire, when thou hast imagined it to be so earnest. For that is not pure and perfect which is tainted with thine own self-seeking.
3. Pete non quod tibi est delectabile et commodum, sed quod mihi acceptabile atque honorificum; quia si recte judicas meam ordinationem tuo desiderio, et omni desiderato præferre debes, ac sequi. Novi desiderium tuum, et frequentes gemitus audivi. Jam velles esse in libertate gloriæ filiorum Dei, jam te delectat domus æterna, et cælestis patria gaudio plena. Sed nondum venit hora ista; sed est adhuc, est aliud temus belli, videlicet tempus laboris et robatinis. Optas summo repleri bono, sed non potes hoc assequi modo. Ego sum, exspecta me, dicit Dominus, donec veniat regnum Dei.	3. “Seek thou not what is pleasant and advantageous to thyself, but what is acceptable and honourable unto Me; for if thou judgest rightly, thou must choose and follow after My appointment rather than thine own desire; yea, rather than anything that can be desired. I know thy desire, and I have heard thy many groanings. Already thou longest to be in the glorious liberty of the children of God; already the eternal home delighteth thee, and the heavenly country full of joy; but the hour is not yet come; there remaineth still another season, even a season of warfare, a season of labour and probation. Thou desirest to be filled with the Chief Good, but thou canst not attain it immediately. I AM that Good; wait for Me, until the Kingdom of God shall come.
4. Probandus es adhuc in terris et in multis exercitandus. Consolatio interdum tibi dabitur, sed copiosa satietas non concedetur. Confortare igitur et esto robustus, tam in agendo quam in patiendo naturæ contraria. Oportet te novum induere hominem, et in alterum virum mutari. Oportet te sæpe agere quod non vis, et quod vis oportet te relinquere. Quod aliis placet, processum habebit; quod tibi placet, ultra non proficiet. Quod alii dicunt, audietur; quod tu dicis, pro nihilo computabitur. Patent alii, et accipient; tu petes nec impetrabis.	4. “Thou must still be tried upon earth, and be exercised in many things. Consolation shall from time to time be given thee, but abundant satisfying shall not be granted. Be strong therefore, and be thou brave both in working and in suffering things which are against thy nature. Thou must put on the new man, and be changed into another man. Thou must often do what thou wouldst not; and thou must leave undone what thou wouldst do. What pleaseth others shall have good success, what pleaseth thee shall have no prosperity. What others say shall be listened to; what thou sayest shall receive no heed. Others shall ask and receive; thou shalt ask and not obtain.
5. Erunt alii magni in ore hominum; de te autem tacebitur. Aliis hoc vel illud committetur, tu autem ad nihil utilis judicaberis. Nam propter alium natura contristabitur, sed magnum fructum sibi silens reportabit. In his et similibus multis probari solet fidelis Domini servus, qualiter se in omnibus abnegare, et in omnibus frangere quærit. Vix est aliquid tale, in quo tantundem mori indiges, sicut videre et pati, quæ voluntati tuæ adversa sunt; maxime autem cum disconvenientia, et quæ minus tibi utilia apparent, fieri jubentur. Et quia non audes resistere altiori potestati, sub dominio constitutus, ideo durum tibi videtur ad nutum alterius ambulare, et omne proprium sentire omittere.	5. Others shall be great in the report of men, but about thee shall nothing be spoken. To others this or that shall be entrusted; thou shalt be judged useful for nought. “For this cause nature shall sometimes be filled with sadness; and it is a great thing if thou bear it silently. In this and many like things the faithful servant of the Lord is wont to be tried, how far he is able to deny himself and bring himself into subjection in all things. Scarcely is there anything in which thou hast need to mortify thyself so much as in seeing things which are adverse to thy will; especially when things are commanded thee to be done which seem to thee inexpedient or of little use to thee. And because thou darest not resist a higher power, being under authority, therefore it seemeth hard for thee to shape thy course according to the nod of another, and to forego thine own opinion.
6. Sed pensa, fili, horum fructum laborum, celerem finem atque præmium nimis magnum, et non habebis inde gravamen, sed fortissimum patientiæ tuæ solamen. Nam et pro modica hac voluntate, quam modo sponte deseris, habebis semper voluntatem tuam in cælis. Ibi quippe invenies omne quod volueris, omne quod desiderare potes. Ibi aderit tibi totius facultas boni sine timore amittendi. Ibi voluntas tua una semper mecum; nil cupies extraneum vel privatum. Ibi nullus resistet tibi, nemo de te conqueretur, nemo te impediet, nihil obviabit: sed cuncta desiderata simul erunt præsentia, totumque tuum affectum reficient, et adimplebunt usque ad summum. Ibi reddam gloriam pro contumelia perpessa, pallium laudis pro mærore, pro loco novissimo sedem regni in sæcula. Ibi apparebit fuctus obedientiæ; gaudebit labor pœitentiæ, et humilis subjectio coronabitur gloriose.	6. “But consider, My Son, the fruit of these labours, the swift end, and the reward exceeding great; and thou shalt find it no pain to bear them then, but rather the strongest solace of thy patience. For even in exchange for this trifling desire which thou hast readily forsaken, thou shalt always have thy will in Heaven. There verily thou shalt find all that thou wouldst, all that thou canst long for. There thou shalt have all good within thy power without the fear of losing it. There thy will, ever at one with Mine, shall desire nothing outward, nothing for itself. There no man shall withstand thee, none shall complain of thee, none shall hinder, nothing shall stand in thy path; but all things desired by thee shall be present together, and shall refresh thy whole affection, and fill it up even to the brim. There I will glory for the scorn suffered here, the garment of praise for sorrow, and for the lowest place a throne in the Kingdom, for ever. There shall appear the fruit of obedience, the labour of repentance shall rejoice, and humble subjection shall be crowned gloriously.
7. Nunc ergo te inclina humliter sub omnium manibus, nec sit curæ, quia hoc dixerit, ve jusserit: sed hoc magno opere curato, ut sive Prælatus, sive minor au æqualis aliud a te exposcerit vel innuerit, pro bono totum accipias, et sincera voluntate studeas adimplere.  Quærat alius hoc, alius illud; glorietur ille in illo, et iste in isto; laudenturque millies mille, tu autem nec isto nec illo: sed tui ipsius gaude contemtu, et in mei solius beneplacito ac honore. Hoc optandum est tibi, ut sive per vitam sive per mortem Deus semper in te glorificetur.	7. “Now therefore bow thyself humbly under the hands of all men; nor let it trouble thee who said this or who ordered that; but take special heed that whether thy superior, thy inferior, or thy equal, require anything from thee, or even show a desire for it; take it all in good part, and study with a good will to fulfil the desire. Let one seek this, another that; let this man glory in this, and that man in that, and be praised a thousand thousand times, but rejoice thou only in the contempt of thyself, and in Mine own good pleasure and glory. This is what thou art to long for, even that whether by life or by death God may be ever magnified in thee.”
Cap. 50. Qualiter homo defolatus debet se in manus Dei offerre.	CHAPTER L How a desolate man ought to commit himself into the hands of God
1. Domine Deus, sancte Pater, sis nunc et in æternum benedictus, quia sicut vis ita factum est, et quod facis bonum est. Lætetur in te servus tuus, non in se, nec in aliquo alio, quia tu solus lætitia vera, tu spes mea, et corona mea, tu gaudium meum, et honor meus, Domine. Quid habet servus tuus, nisi quod a te accepit, etiam sine merito suo? Tua sunt omnia, quæ dedisti et quæ fecisti.Pauper sum et in laboribus a juventute mea,et contristatur anima mea, nonnunquam usque ad lacrymas, quandoque etiam conturbatur spiritus meus a se propter imminentes passiones.	1. O Lord, Holy Father, be Thou blessed now and evermore; because as Thou wilt so it is done, and what Thou doest is good. Let Thy servant rejoice in Thee, not in himself, nor in any other; because Thou alone art the true joy, Thou art my hope and my crown, Thou art my joy and my honour, O Lord. What hath Thy servant, which he received not from Thee, even without merit of his own? Thine are all things which Thou hast given, and which Thou hast made. I am poor and in misery even from my youth up, and my soul is sorrowful unto tears, sometimes also it is disquieted within itself, because of the sufferings which are coming upon it.
2. Desidero pacis agudium, filiorum tuorum pacis flagito, qui in lumine consolationis a te pascuntur. Si das pacem, si gaudium sanctum infundis, erit anima servi tui plena modulatione, et devota in laude tua. Sed si te subtraxeris sicut sæpissime soles, non poterit currere viam mandatorum tuorum, sed magis ad tundendum pectus genua incurvantur, quia non est illi sicut heri, et nudiustertius, quando lucebat lucerna tua super caput ejus, et sub umbra alarum tuarum protegebatur a tentationibus irruentibus.	2. I long after the joy of peace; for the peace of Thy children do I beseech, for in the light of Thy comfort they are fed by Thee. If Thou give peace, if Thou pour into me holy joy, the soul of Thy servant shall be full of melody, and devout in Thy praise. But if Thou withdraw Thyself as too often Thou art wont, he will not be able to run in the way of Thy commandments, but rather he will smite his breast and will bow his knees; because it is not with him as yesterday and the day before, when Thy candle shined upon his head , and he walked under the shadow of Thy wings , from the temptations which beset him.
3. Pater juste, et semper laudande, venit hora, ut probetur servus tuus. Pater amande, dignum est, ut hora hac patiatur pro te aliquid servus tuus. Pater perpetuo venerande, venit hora quam ab æterno præsciebas affuturam, ut ad modicum tempus succumbat foris servus tuus; vivat vero semper apud te intus, paululum vilipendatur, humilietur et deficiet coram hominibus, passionibus conteratur et languoribus, ut iterum tecum in aurora lucis novæ resurgat, et in cælestibus clarificetur. Pater sancte, tu sic ordinasti, et sic voluisti, et hoc factum est quod præcepisti.	3. O Father, righteous and ever to be praised, the hour cometh when Thy servant is to be proved. O beloved Father, it is well that in this hour Thy servant suffer somewhat for Thy sake. O Father, evermore to be adored, as the hour cometh which Thou foreknewest from everlasting, when for a little while Thy servant should outwardly bow down, but always live inwardly with Thee; when for a little while he should be little regarded, humbled, and fail in the eyes of men; should be wasted with sufferings and weaknesses, to rise again with Thee in the dawn of the new light, and be glorified in the heavenly places. O Holy Father, thou hast ordained it so, and so hast willed it; and that is done which Thou Thyself hast commanded.
4. Est hæc enim gratia ad amicum tuum, pati et tribulari in mundo pro amore to, quotiescumque et a quocumque et quomodocumque id permiseris fieri. Sine consilio et providentia tua, et sine causa nihil fit in terra.Bonum mihi,Domine,quod humiliasti me ut discam justificationes tuas,et omnes elatines cordis atque præsumtiones abjiciam. Utile michi, quod confusio cooperuit faciem meam, ut te potius quam homines ad consolandum requiram. Didici etiam ex hoc inscrutabile judicium tuum expavescere, qui affligis justum cum impio, sed non sine æquitate et justitia.	4. For this is Thy favour to Thy friend, that he should suffer and be troubled in the world for Thy love’s sake, how often soever, and by whomsoever and whosoever Thou hast suffered it to be done. Without Thy counsel and providence, and without cause, nothing cometh to pass on the earth. It is good for me, Lord, that I had been in trouble, that I may learn Thy statutes, and may cast away all pride of heart and presumption. It is profitable for me that confusion hath covered my face, that I may seek to Thee for consolation rather than unto men. By this also I have learned to dread Thine unsearchable judgment, who afflictest the just with the wicked, but not without equity and justice.
5. Gratias tibi, quia non pepercisti malis meis, sed attrivisti me verberibus amaris, infligens dolores et immittens angustias foris et intus. Non est qui me consoletur ex omnibus quæsub cælo sunt, nisi tu, Domine Deus meus, cælestis medicus animarum, quipercutis et sanas, deducis ad inferos et reducis.Disciplina tua super me et virga tua ipsa me docebit.	5. Thanks be unto Thee, because Thou hast not spared my sins, but hast beaten me with stripes of love, inflicting pains, and sending troubles upon me without and within. There is none who can console me, of all things which are under heaven, but Thou only, O Lord my God, Thou heavenly Physician of souls, who dost scourge and hast mercy, who leadest down to hell and bringest up again. Thy discipline over me, and Thy rod itself shall teach me.
6. Ecce, Pater dilecte, in manibus tuis ego sum; sub virga correctionis tuæ me inclino: percute dorsum meum et collum meum, ut incurvem ad voluntatem tuam tortuositatem meam. Fac me pium et humilem discipulum, sicut bene facere consuevisti, ut ambulem ad omnem nutum tuum. Tibi me et omnia mea ad corrigendum committo: melius est hic corripi quam in futuro. Tu scis omnia et singula, et nihil te latet in humana conscientia. Antequam fiant, nosti ventura, et non opus tibi est ut quis te doceat aut admoneat de his quæ fiunt in terra. Tu scis quid expediat ad profectum meum et quantum deservit tribulatio ad rubiginem vitiorum purgandum. Fac mecum desideratum beneplacitum tuum et ne despicias peccaminosam vitam meam, nulli melius et clarius quam tibi soli notam.	6. Behold, O beloved Father, I am in Thy hands, I bow myself under the rod of Thy correction. Smite my back and my neck that I may bend my crookedness to Thy will. Make me a pious and lowly disciple, as Thou wert wont to be kind, that I may walk according to every nod of Thine. To Thee I commend myself and all that I have for correction; better is it to be punished here than hereafter. Thou knowest all things and each of them; and nothing remaineth hid from Thee in man’s conscience. Before they are, thou knowest that they will be, and Thou needest not that any man teach Thee or admonish Thee concerning the things which are done upon the earth. Thou knowest what is expedient for my profit, and how greatly trouble serveth unto the scrubbing off the rust of sin. Do with me according to Thy desired good pleasure, and despise not my life which is full of sin, known to none so entirely and fully as to Thee alone.
7. Da mihi, Domine, scire quod sciendum est, hoc amare quod amandum est, hoc laudare quod tibi summe placet, hoc reputare quod tibi prætiosum apparet, hoc vituperare quod tibi sordescit. Non me sinas secundam visionem oculorum exteriorum judicare, neque secundum auditum aurium hominum imperitorum sententiare: sed in judicio vero de visibilibus et spiritualibus discernere atque super omnia voluntatem beneplaciti tui semper inquirere.	7. Grant me, O Lord, to know that which ought to be known; to love that which ought to be loved; to praise that which pleaseth Thee most, to esteem that which is precious in Thy sight, to blame that which is vile in Thine eyes. Suffer me not to judge according to the sight of bodily eyes, nor to give sentence according to the hearing of the ears of ignorant men; but to discern in true judgment between visible and spiritual things, and above all things to be ever seeking after the will of Thy good pleasure.
8. Falluntur sæpe hominum sensus in judicando; falluntur et amatores sæculi visibilia tantummodo amando. Quid enim homo inde melior, quia reputabitur ab homine major? Fallax fallacem, vanus vanum, cæcus cæcum, infirmus infirmum decipit, dum exaltat et veraciter magis confundit, dum inaniter laudat. Nam quantum unusquisque est in oculis tuis, tantum est et non amplius, ait humilis sanctus Franciscus.	8. Oftentimes the senses of men are deceived in judging; the lovers of the world also are deceived in that they love only visible things. What is a man better because by man he is reckoned very great? The deceiver deceiveth the deceiver, the vain man the vain, the blind man the blind, the weak man the weak, when they exalt one another; and in truth they rather put to shame, while they foolishly praise. For as humble St. Francis saith, “What each one is in Thine eyes, so much he is, and no more.”
Cap. 51. Quod humilibus insistendum est operibus, cum deficitur a summis.	CHAPTER LI That we must give ourselves to humble works when we are unequal to those that are lofty
1. Fili mi, non semper vales in serventiori desiderio virtutum stare nec in altiori gradu contemplationis, sed necesse habes interdum ob originalem corruptelam ad inferiora descendere, et onus corruptibilis vitæ etiam invite et cum tædio portare. Quamdiu mortale corpus geris, tædium senties et gravamen cordis. Oportet ergo sæpe in carne de carnis onere gemere, eo guod non vales spiritualibus studiis, et divinæ contemplationi indefinenter inhærere.	1. “My Son, thou art not always able to continue in very fervent desire after virtues, nor to stand fast in the loftier region of contemplation; but thou must of necessity sometimes descend to lower things because of thine original corruption, and bear about the burden of corruptible life, though unwillingly and with weariness. So long as thou wearest a mortal body, thou shalt feel weariness and heaviness of heart. Therefore thou oughtest to groan often in the flesh because of the burden of the flesh, inasmuch as thou canst not give thyself to spiritual studies and divine contemplation unceasingly.
2. Tunc expedit tibi ad humilia et exteriora opera confugere, et in bonis te actibus recreare, adventum meum et supernam visitationem firma confidentia exspectare, exilium tuum et ariditatem mentis patienter sufferre, donec iterum a me visiteris, et ab omnibus anxietatibus libereris. Nam faciam te laborum oblivisci, et interna quiete perfrui. Expandam coram te prata scripturarum, ut dilatato corde currere incipas viam mandatorum emorum, et dices:Non sunt condignaæ passiones hujus temproris ad futuram gloriam quæ revelabitur in nobis.	2. “At such a time it is expedient for thee to flee to humble and external works, and to renew thyself with good actions; to wait for My coming and heavenly visitation with sure confidence; to bear thy exile and drought of mind with patience, until thou be visited by Me again, and be freed from all anxieties. For I will cause thee to forget thy labours, and altogether to enjoy eternal peace. I will spread open before thee the pleasant pastures of the Scriptures, that with enlarged heart thou mayest begin to run in the way of My commandments. And thou shalt say, ‘The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.’”
Cap. 52. Quod homo non reputet se consolatione dignum, sed magis verberibus dignum.	CHAPTER LII That a man ought not to reckon himself worthy of consolation, but more worthy of chastisement
1. Domine, non sum dignus consolatione tua, nec aliqua spirituali visitatione: et ideo juste mecum agis, quando me inopem et desolatum relinquis. Si enim ad instar maris lacrymas fundere possem, adhuc consolatione tua dignus non essem. Unde nihil dignus sum quam flagellari et puniri, quia graviter et sæpe te offendi, et in multis valde deliqui. Ergo vera pensata ratione, nec minima sum dignus consolatione. Sed tu clemens et misericors, quia non vis perire opera tua, ad ostendendum divitias bonitatis tuæ in vasa misericordiæ tuæ, etiam propter omne proprium meritum dignaris consolari servum tuum supra humanum modum. Tuæ enim consolationes non sunt sicut humanæ confabulationes.	1. O Lord, I am not worthy of Thy consolation, nor of any spiritual visitation; and therefore Thou dealest justly with me, when Thou leavest me poor and desolate. For if I were able to pour forth tears like the sea, still should I not be worthy of Thy consolation. Therefore am I nothing worthy save to be scourged and punished, because I have grievously and many a time offended Thee, and in many things have greatly sinned. Therefore, true account being taken, I am not worthy even of the least of Thy consolations. But Thou, gracious and merciful God, who willest not that Thy works should perish, to show forth the riches of Thy mercy upon the vessels of mercy, vouchsafest even beyond all his own deserving, to comfort Thy servant above the measure of mankind. For Thy consolations are not like unto the discoursings of men.
2. Quid egi, Domine, ut mihi conferres aliquam cælestem consolationem? Ego nihil boni egisse recolo me, sed semper ad vitia pronum, et ad emendationem pigrum fuisse. Verum est, et abnegare non possum; si aliter dicerem, tu stares contra me, et non esset qui defenderet.  Quid merui pro peccatis meis, nisi infernum, et ignem æternum? In veritate confiteor, quoniam dignus sum omni ludibrio et contemtu; nec decet me inter devotos tuos commarari. Et licet hoc ægre audiam, tamen adversum me pro veritate peccata mea arguam, ut facilius misericordiam tuam valeam impetrare.	2. What have I done, O Lord, that Thou shouldst bestow any heavenly comfort upon me? I remember not that I have done any good, but have been ever prone to sin and slow to amendment. It is true and I cannot deny it. If I should say otherwise, Thou wouldst rise up against me, and there would be none to defend me. What have I deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire? In very truth I confess that I am worthy of all scorn and contempt, nor is it fit that I should be remembered among Thy faithful servants. And although I be unwilling to hear this, nevertheless I will for the Truth’s sake, accuse myself of my sins, that the more readily I may prevail to be accounted worthy of Thy mercy.
3. Quid dicam reus, et omni confusione plenus? Non habeo os loquendi, nisi hoc tantum verbum: Peccavi, Domine, peccavi: miserere mei, ignosce mihi.Sine me paululum, ut plangam dolorem meum, antequam vadam ad terram tenebrosam, et opertam mortis caligine.Quid tam maxime a reo et misero peccatore requiris nisi ut conteratur et humiliet se pro delictis suis? In vera contritione, et cordis humiliatione nascitur spes veniæ, reconciliatur perturbata conscientia, recuperatur gratia perdita, tuetur homo a futura ira, et occurrunt sibi mutuo in osculo sancto Deus et pœnitens anima.	3. What shall I say, guilty that I am and filled with confusion? I have no mouth to utter, unless it be this word alone, “I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned; have mercy upon me, forgive me.” Let me alone, that I may take comfort a little before I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death. What dost Thou so much require of a guilty and miserable sinner, as that he be contrite, and humble himself for his sins? In true contrition and humiliation of heart is begotten the hope of pardon, the troubled conscience is reconciled, lost grace is recovered, a man is preserved from the wrath to come, and God and the penitent soul hasten to meet each other with a holy kiss.
4. Humilis peccatorum contritio acceptabile tibi est, Domine, sacrificium, longe suavius odorans in conspectu tuo, quam thuris incesum. Hoc est gratum etiam unguentum, quod sacris pedibus tuis infundi volusti, quiacor contritum, et humiliatum nunquam despexisti.Ibi est locus refugii a facie iræ inimici; ibi emendatur et abluitur quidquid aliunde contractum est in inquinatum.	4. The humble contrition of sinners is an acceptable sacrifice unto Thee, O Lord, sending forth a smell sweeter far in Thy sight than the incense. This also is that pleasant ointment which Thou wouldst have poured upon Thy sacred feet, for a broken and contrite heart Thou hast never despised. There is the place of refuge from the wrathful countenance of the enemy. There is amended and washed away whatsoever evil hath elsewhere been contracted.
Cap. 53. De gratia quæ non miscetur terrena sapientibus.	CHAPTER LIII That the Grace of God doth not join itself to those who mind earthly things
1. Fili, prætiosa est gratia mea, non patitur se misceri extraneis rebus, nec consolationibus terrenis. Abjicere ergo oportet omnia impedimenta gratiæ, si optas ejus infusionem suscipere. Pete secretum tibi; ama solus habitare tecum, nullius require confabulatinem, sed magis ad Deum devotam effunde precem, ut devotam teneas mentem, et puram conscientiam. Totum mundum nihil exstima, Dei vacationem omnibus exterioribus antepone. Non enim poteris mihi vacare et in transitoriis pariter delectari. A notis et a charis oportet elongari et ab omni temporali solatio mentem tenere privatam. Sic obsecrat beatus Apostolus Petrus, ut tanquam advenas et peregrinos in hoc mundo se contineant Christi fideles.	1. “My Son, precious is My grace, it suffereth not itself to be joined with outward things, nor with earthly consolations. Therefore thou oughtest to cast away all things which hinder grace, if thou longest to receive the inpouring thereof. Seek a secret place for thyself, love to dwell alone with thyself, desire the conversation of no one; but rather pour out thy devout prayer to God, that thou mayest possess a contrite mind and a pure conscience. Count the whole world as nought; seek to be alone with God before all outward things. For thou canst not be alone with Me, and at the same time be delighted with transitory things. Thou oughtest to be separated from thy acquaintances and dear friends, and keep thy mind free from all worldly comfort. So the blessed Apostle Peter beseecheth, that Christ’s faithful ones bear themselves in this world as strangers and pilgrims.
2. O, quanta fiducia erit morituro, quem nullius rei affectus detinet in mundo. Sed sic segregatum cor habere in omnibus, æger necdum capit animus, nec animalis homo novit interni hominis libertatem. Attamen si vere velit esse spiritualis, oportet eum renuntiare tam remotis, quam propinquis, et a nemine magis cavere, quam a se ipso. Si te ipsum perfecte viceris, cætera facilis subjugabis. Perfecta namque victoria est de semetipso triumphare: qui enim semetipsum subjectum tenet, ut sensualitas rationi, et ratio in cunctis obediat mihi, hic vere victor sui est et dominus mundi.	2. “Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world? But to have a heart so separated from all things, a sickly soul doth not yet comprehend, nor doth the carnal man know the liberty of the spiritual man. But if indeed he desire to be spiritually minded, he must renounce both those who are far off, and those who are near, and to beware of no man more than himself. If thou perfectly conquer thyself, very easily shalt thou subdue all things besides. Perfect victory is the triumph over oneself. For whoso keepeth himself in subjection, in such manner that the sensual affections obey the reason, and the reason in all things obeyeth Me, he truly is conqueror of himself, and lord of the world.
3. Si ad hunc apicem scandere gliscis, oportet viriliter incipere et securim ad radicem ponere, ut evellas et destruas occultam in inordinatam inclinationem ad te ipsum et ad omne privatum inclinationem ad te ipsum et ad omne privatum et materiale bonum. Ex hoc vitio quod homo semetipsum nimis inordinate diligit, pene totum pendet quidquid radicaliter vincendum est, quo devicto et subacto malo, pax magna et tranquillitas erit continuo. Sed quia pauci sibi ipsi mori perfecte laborant, nec plene extra se tendunt, propterea in se implicati remanent, nec supra se elevari in spiritu possunt. Qui autem libere mecum ambulare desiderat, necesse est, ut omnes pravas et inordinatas affectiones suas mortificet atque nulli creaturæ privato amore concupiscenter inhæreat.	3. “If thou desire to climb to this height, thou oughtest to start bravely, and to lay the axe to the root, to the end that thou mayest pull up and destroy the hidden inordinate inclination towards thyself, and towards all selfish and earthly good. From this sin, that a man loveth himself too inordinately, almost everything hangeth which needeth to be utterly overcome: when that evil is conquered and put under foot, there shall be great peace and tranquillity continually. But because few strive earnestly to die perfectly to themselves, and do not heartily go forth from themselves, therefore do they remain entangled in themselves, and cannot be raised in spirit above themselves. But he who desireth to walk at liberty with Me, must of necessity mortify all his evil and inordinate affections, and must cling to no creature with selfish love.”
Cap. 54. De diversis motibus naturæ et gratiæ.	CHAPTER LIV Of the diverse motions of Nature and of Grace
1. Fili, diligenter adverte motus naturæ et gratiæ: quia valde contrarie et subtiliter moventur, et vix nisi a spirituali et intime illuminato homine discernuntur. Omnes quidem bonum appetunt, et aliquid boni in suis dictis vel factis prætendunt: ideo sub specie boni multi saluntur.	1. “My Son, pay diligent heed to the motions of Nature and of Grace, because they move in a very contrary and subtle manner, and are hardly distinguished save by a spiritual and inwardly enlightened man. All men indeed seek good, and make pretence of something good in all that they say or do; and thus under the appearance of good many are deceived.
2. Natura callida est et multos trahit, illaqueat, et decipit, et se semper pro fine habet. Sed gratia simpliciter ambulat, et ab omni specie mala decinat, fallacias non prætendit, et omnia pure propter Deum agit, in quo et finaliter requiescit.	2. “Nature is deceitful and draweth away, ensnareth, and deceiveth many, and always hath self for her end; but Grace walketh in simplicity and turneth away from every appearance of evil, maketh no false pretences, and doeth all entirely for the sake of God, in whom also she finally resteth.
3. Natura invite vult mori, nec premi nec superari vult, nec subesee nec sponte subjugari. Gratia vero studet mortificationi propriæ, resistit sensualitati, quærit subjici, appetit vinci, nec propria vult libertate fungi, sub disciplina amat teneri, nec alicui cupit dominari: sed sub Dei semper vivere, stare et esse, atque propter Deum omni humanæ creaturæ humiliter parata est inclinari.	3. “Nature is very unwilling to die, and to be pressed down, and to be overcome, and to be in subjection, and to bear the yoke readily; but Grace studieth self-mortification, resisteth sensuality, seeketh to be subdued, longeth to be conquered, and willeth not to use her own liberty. She loveth to be held by discipline, and not to have authority over any, but always to live, to remain, to have her being under God, and for God’s sake is ready to be humbly subject to every ordinance of man.
4. Natura pro suo commodo laborat, et quidquid lucri sibi et alio proveniat attendit. Gratia autem non quid sibi utile et commodum sit, sed quod multis proficiat, magis considerat.	4. “Nature laboureth for her own advantage, and considereth what profit she may gain from another; but Grace considereth more, not what may be useful and convenient to self, but what may be profitable to the many.
5. Natura libenter honorem accipit et reverentiam. Gratia vero omnem honoem, et gloriam Deo fideliter attribuit.	5. “Nature willingly receiveth honour and reverence; but Grace faithfully ascribeth all honour and glory to God.
6. Natura confusionem timet et contemtum. Grata autem gaudet pro nomine Jesu contumeliam pati.	6. “Nature feareth confusion and contempt, but Grace rejoiceth to suffer shame for the name of Jesus.
7. Natura otium amat, et quietem corporalem. Gratia vero vacua esse non potest, sed libenter amplectitur laborem.	7. “Nature loveth ease and bodily quiet; Grace cannot be unemployed, but gladly embraceth labour.
8. Natural quærit curiosa habere et pulchra, et abhorret vilia, et grossa. Gratia vero simplicibus delectatur et humilibus; aspera non aspernatur, nec vetustis refugit indui pannis.	8. “Nature seeketh to possess things curious and attractive, and abhorreth those which are rough and cheap; Grace is delighted with things simple and humble, despiseth not those which are rough, nor refuseth to be clothed with old garments.
9. Natura respicit temporalia, gaudet ad lucra terrena, tristatur de damno, irritatur de levi injuriæ verbo. Sed gratia attendit æterna, non inhæret temporalibus, nec in perditione rerum turbatur, neque verbis durioribus acerbatur, quia thesaurum suum et gaudium in cælo, ubi nihil perit, constituit.	9. “Nature hath regard to things temporal, rejoiceth in earthly lucre, is made sad by loss, vexed by any little injurious word; but Grace reacheth after things eternal, cleaveth not to those which are temporal, is not perturbed by losses, nor embittered by any hard words, because she hath placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nought perisheth.
10. Natura cupida est, et libentius accipit quam donat; amat propria et privata. Gratia autem pia est et communis, vitat singularia, contentatur paucis, beatius judicat dare quam accipere.	10. “Nature is covetous, and receiveth more willingly than she giveth, loveth things that are personal and private to herself; while Grace is kind and generous, avoideth selfishness, is contented with a little, believeth that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
11. Natura inclinat ad creaturas ad carnem propriam, ad vanitatem, et discursus. Sed gratia trahit ad Deum, et ad virtutes, renuntiat creaturis, fugit mundum, odit carnis desideria, restringit evagationes, erubescit in publico apparere.	11. “Nature inclineth thee to created things, to thine own flesh, to vanities and dissipation; but Grace draweth to God and to virtues, renounceth creatures, fleeth from the world, hateth the desires of the flesh, restraineth vagaries, blusheth to be seen in public.
12. Natura aliquod solatium libenter habet externum, in quo delectetur ad sensum. Sed gratia in solo Deo quærit consolari, et in summo bono super omnia visiblia delectari.	12. “Nature is glad to receive some outward solace in which the senses may have delight; but Grace seeketh to be comforted in God alone, and to have delight in the chief good above all visible things.
13. Natura totum agit propter lucrum, et commodum proprium, nihil gratis facere otest: sed aut æquale, aut melius, aut laudem, aut favorem pro benefactis consequi speart et multum ponderari sua gesta et dona et dicta concupiscit. Gratia vero nihil temporale quærit, nec aliud præmium quam Deum solum pro mercede postulat, nec amplius de temporalibus necessariis desiderat, nisi quantum hæc sibi ad affecutionem æternorum valeant deservire.	13. “Nature doeth everything for her own gain and profit, can do nothing as a free favour, but hopeth to attain something as good or better, or some praise or favour for her benefits; and she loveth that her own deeds and gifts should be highly valued; but Grace seeketh nothing temporal, nor requireth any other gift of reward than God alone; neither longeth she for more of temporal necessities than such as may suffice for the attaining of eternal life.
14. Natura gaudet de amicis multis et propinquis, gloriatur de nobili loco, et ortu generis; arridet potentibus, blanditur divitibus, applaudit sibi similibus. Gratia autem etiam inimicos diligit, nec de amicorum turba extollitur, nec locum, nec ortum natalium reputat, nisi ubi virtus major fuerit, favet magis pauperi quam diviti, compatitur plus innocenti quam potenti, congaudet veraci et non fallaci, exhortatur semper bonos meliora charismata æmulari, et Filio Dei per virtutes assimilari.	14. “Nature rejoiceth in many friends and kinsfolk, she boasteth of noble place and noble birth, she smileth on the powerful, flattereth the rich, applaudeth those who are like herself; but Grace loveth even her enemies, and is not lifted up by the multitude of friends, setteth no store upon high place or high birth, unless there be greater virtue therewith; favoureth the poor man more than the rich, hath more sympathy with the innocent than with the powerful; rejoiceth with the truthful, not with the liar; always exhorteth the good to strive after better gifts of grace, and to become by holiness like unto the Son of God.
15. Natura de defectu et molestia cito conqueritur. Gratia constanter fert inopiam.	15. “Nature quickly complaineth of poverty and of trouble; Grace beareth want with constancy.
16. Natura ad se omnia reflectit, pro se certat et arguit. Gratia autem ad Deum cuncta reducit, unde originaliter emanant, nihil boni sibi adscribit nec arroganter præsumit, non contendit, nec suam sententiam aliis præfert, sed in omni sensu, et intellectu æternæ sapientiæ ac divino examini se submittit.	16. “Nature looketh upon all things in reference to herself; striveth and argueth for self; but Grace bringeth back all things to God from whom they came at the beginning; ascribeth no good to herself nor arrogantly presumeth; is not contentious, nor preferreth her own opinion to others, but in every sense and understanding submitteth herself to the Eternal wisdom and the Divine judgment.
17. Natura appetit scire secreta, et nova audire; vult exterius apparere et multa per sensus experiri; desiderat agnosci, et agere unde laus et admiratio procedit. Sed gratia non curat nova nec curiosa percipere, quia totum hoc de vetustate corruptonis est ortum, cum nihil novum et durabile est super terram. Docet itaque sensus restringere, vanam complacentiam et ostentationem devitare, laudanda et digne miranda humiliter abscondere, et de omni re et de omni scientia utilitatis fructum, atque Dei laudem et honorem quærere. Non vult se nec sua prædicari; sed Deum in donis suis optat benedici, qui cuncta ex mera charitate largitur.	17. “Nature is eager to know secrets and to hear new things; she loveth to appear abroad, and to make experience of many things through the senses; she desireth to be acknowledged and to do those things which win praise and admiration; but Grace careth not to gather up new or curious things, because all this springeth from the old corruption, whereas there is nothing new or lasting upon earth. So she teacheth to restrain the senses, to shun vain complacency and ostentation, to hide humbly those things which merit praise and real admiration, and from everything and in all knowledge to seek after useful fruit, and the praise and honour of God. She desireth not to receive praise for herself or her own, but longeth that God be blessed in all His gifts, who out of unmingled love bestoweth all things.”
18. Hæc gratia supernaturale lumen, et quoddam Dei speciale donum est, et proprie electorum signaculum, et pignus salutis æternæ: quæ hominem de terrenis ad cælestia amanda sustollit, et de carnali spiritualem efficit. Quanto igitur natura amplius premitur, et vincitur, tanto major gratia infunditur, et quotidie novis visitationibus interior homo secundum imaginem Dei formatur.	18. This Grace is a supernatural light, and a certain special gift of God, and the proper mark of the elect, and the pledge of eternal salvation; it exalteth a man from earthly things to love those that are heavenly; and it maketh the carnal man spiritual. So far therefore as Nature is utterly pressed down and overcome, so far is greater Grace bestowed and the inner man is daily created anew by fresh visitations, after the image of God.
Cap. 55. De corruptione naturæ, et efficacia gratiæ divinæ.	CHAPTER LV Of the corruption of Nature and the efficacy of Divine Grace
1. Domine Deus meus, qui me creasti ad imaginem et similitudinem tuam: concede mihi hanc gratiam, quam ostendisti mhi tam magnam et necessariam ad salutem, ut vincam pessimam naturam meam trahentem me ad peccata et in perditionem. Sentio enim in carne mea legem peccati, contradicentem legi mentis meæ, et captivum me ducentem ad obediendum sensualitati in multis, nec possum resistere passionibus ejus, nisi assistat tua sanctissima gratia, cordi meo ardenter infusa.	1. O Lord my God, who hast created me after thine own image and similitude, grant me this grace, which Thou hast shown to be so great and so necessary for salvation, that I may conquer my wicked nature, which draweth me to sin and to perdition. For I feel in my flesh the law of sin, contradicting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the obedience of sensuality in many things; nor can I resist its passions, unless Thy most holy grace assist me, fervently poured into my heart.
2. Opus est gratia tua et magna gratia, ut vincatur natura ad malum semper prona ab adolescentia sua. Nam per primum hominem Adam lapsa, et vitiata per peccatum, in omnes homines pœ hujus maculæ descendit, ut ipsa natura, quæ bene et recte a te condita fuit, pro vitio jam et infirmitate corruptæ naturæ ponatur, eo quod motus ejus, sibi relictus, ad malum et inferiora trahit. Nam modica vis, quæ remansit, est tamquam scintilla quædam latens in cinere. Hæc est ipsa caro naturalis, circumfusa magna caligine, adhuc judicium habens boni et mali, veri falsique distantiam, licet impotens sit adimplere omne quod probat, nec pleno jam lumine veritatis, nec sanitate affectionem suarum potiatur.	2. There is need of Thy grace, yea, and of a great measure thereof, that my nature may be conquered, which hath alway been prone to evil from my youth. For being fallen through the first man Adam, and corrupted through sin, the punishment of this stain descended upon all men; so that Nature itself, which was framed good and right by Thee, is now used to express the vice and infirmity of corrupted Nature; because its motion left unto itself draweth men away to evil and to lower things. For the little power which remaineth is as it were one spark lying hid in the ashes. This is Natural reason itself, encompassed with thick clouds, having yet a discernment of good and evil, a distinction of the true and the false, though it be powerless to fulfil all that it approveth, and possess not yet the full light of truth, nor healthfulness of its affections.
3. Hinc est, Deus meus, quodcondelector legi tuæ, secundum interiorem hominem, sciens mandatum tuum fore bonum, justum et sanctum, arguens etiam omne malum et peccatum fugiendum. Carni autem servio lege peccati, dum magis sensualitati obedio, quam rationi. Hinc est quod velle bonum mihi adjacet, perficere autem non invenio. Hin sæpe bona multa propono, sed quia gratia deest ad adjuvandam infirmitatem meam, ex levi resistentia exilio et deficio. Hinc accidit quod viam perfectorum agnosco, et qualiter agere debeam, satis clare video: sed propriæ corruptionis pondere pressus ad perfectiora non assurgo.	3. Hence it is, O my God, that I delight in Thy law after the inward man, knowing that Thy commandment is holy and just and good; reproving also all evil, and the sin that is to be avoided: yet with the flesh I serve the law of sin, whilst I obey sensuality rather than reason. Hence it is that to will to do good is present with me, but how to perform it I find not. Hence I ofttimes purpose many good things; but because grace is lacking to help mine infirmities, I fall back before a little resistance and fail. Hence it cometh to pass that I recognize the way of perfectness, and see very clearly what things I ought to do; but pressed down by the weight of my own corruption, I rise not to the things which are more perfect.
4. O, quam maxime est mihi necessaria gratia tua, Domine, ad inchoandum bonum, ad proficiendum et ad perficiendum. Nam sine te nihil possum facere; omnia autem possum in te, confortante me gratia tua. O, vere cælestis, gratia, sine qua nulla sunt propria merita, nulla quoque dona naturaæ ponderanda. Nihil artes, nihil divitiæ, nihil pulchritudo vel fortitudo, nihil igneium vel eloquentia valent apud te, Domine, sine gratia tua. Nam bona naturaæ bonis et malis sunt communia: Electorum autem proprium donum est gratia, sive dilectio, qua insigniti digni habenter vita æterna. Tantum eminet hæc gratia, ut nec donum prophetiæ, nec signorum operatio, nec quantalibet alta speculatio aliquid æstimetur sine ea. Sed neque fides neque spes neque aliæ virtutes sine charitate et gratia tibi acceptæ sunt.	4. Oh how entirely necessary is Thy grace to me, O Lord, for a good beginning, for progress, and for bringing to perfection. For without it I can do nothing, but I can do all things through Thy grace which strengtheneth me. O truly heavenly grace, without which our own merits are nought, and no gifts of Nature at all are to be esteemed. Arts, riches, beauty, strength, wit, eloquence, they all avail nothing before Thee, O Lord, without Thy grace. For the gifts of Nature belong to good and evil alike; but the proper gift of the elect is grace—that is, love—and they who bear the mark thereof are held worthy of everlasting life. So mighty is this grace, that without it neither the gift of prophecy nor the working of miracles, nor any speculation, howsoever lofty, is of any value at all. But neither faith, nor hope, nor any other virtue is accepted with Thee without love and grace.
5. O, beatissima gratia, quæ pauperem spiritu virtutibus divitem facis, et divitem multis bonis humilem corde reddis. Veni, descende ad me, reple me mane misericordia tua et consolatione tua, ne deficiat præ lassitudine et ariditate mentis anima mea. Obsecro, Domine, ut inveniam gratiam in oculis tuis: sufficit enim mihi gratia cæteris non obtentis quæ desiert natura. Si fuero vexatus et tentatus tribulationibus multis, non timebo mala, dum fuerit mecum gratia tua. Ipsa fortitudo mea, ipsa consilium confert et axilium. Cunctis hostibus potentior est et sapientior universis sapientibus.	5. O most blessed grace that makest the poor in spirit rich in virtues, and renderest him who is rich in many things humble in spirit, come Thou, descend upon me, fill me early with Thy consolation, lest my soul fail through weariness and drought of mind. I beseech thee, O Lord, that I may find grace in Thy sight, for Thy grace is sufficient for me, when I obtain not those things which Nature longeth for. If I be tempted and vexed with many tribulations, I will fear no evil, while Thy grace remaineth with me. This alone is my strength, this bringeth me counsel and help. It is more powerful than all enemies, and wiser than all the wise men in the world.
6. Magistra est veritatis, doctrix disciplinæ, lumen cordis, solamen pressuræ, fugatrix tristitiæ, ablatrix timoris, nutrix devotionis, productrix lacrymarum. Quid sum sine ea nisi aridum lignum et stips inutilis ad ejiciendum? Tua ergo, Domine, gratia me semper præbenitat, et sequatur ac bonis operibus jugiter præstet esse intentum per Jesum Christum Filium tuum. Amen.	6. It is the mistress of truth, the teacher of discipline, the light of the heart, the solace of anxiety, the banisher of sorrow, the deliverer from fear, the nurse of devotion, the drawer forth of tears. What am I without it, save a dry tree, a useless branch, worthy to be cast away! “Let Thy grace, therefore, O Lord, always prevent and follow me, and make me continually given to all good works, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son. Amen.”
Cap. 56. Quod nosmetipsos abnegare et Christum imitari debemus per crucem.	CHAPTER LVI That we ought to deny ourselves, and to imitate Christ by means of the Cross
1. Fili, quantum vales a te exire, tantum in me poteris pertransire. Sicut nihil foris concupiscere internam pacem facit, sic se interius relinquere Deo conjungit. Volo te addiscere perfectam abnegationem tui in voluntate mea, sine contradictione et querela. Sequere me:Ego sum via, veritas, et vita.Sine via non itur; sine veritate non cognoscitur; sine vita non vivitur. Ego sum via, quam sequi debes, veritas, cui credere debes, vita, quam sperare debes. Ego sum via inviolabilis, veritas infallibilis, vita interminabilis. Ego sum via rectissima, veritas suprema, vita vera, vita beata, vita increata. Si maseris in via mea, cognosces veritatem, et veritas liberabit te et apprehendes vitram æternam.	. My Son, so far as thou art able to go out of thyself so far shalt thou be able to enter into Me. As to desire no outward thing worketh internal peace, so the forsaking of self inwardly joineth unto God. I will that thou learn perfect self-denial, living in My will without contradiction or complaint. Follow Me: I am the way, the truth, and the life. Without the way thou canst not go, without the truth thou canst not know, without the life thou canst not live. I am the Way which thou oughtest to follow; the Truth which thou oughtest to believe; the Life which thou oughtest to hope for. I am the Way unchangeable; the Truth infallible; the Life everlasting. I am the Way altogether straight, the Truth supreme, the true Life, the blessed Life, the uncreated Life. If thou remain in My way thou shalt know the Truth, and the truth shall make thee free, and thou shalt lay hold on eternal life.
2.Si vis ad vitam ingredi, serva mandata.Si vis veritatem cognoscere, crede mihi.Si vis perfectus esse, vende omnia.Si vis esse discipulus meus, abnega temetipsum. Si vis beatam vitam possidere præsentem vitam contemne. Si vis exaltari in cælo, humilia te in mundo. Si vis regnare mecum, porta crecem mecum. Soli enim servi crucis inveniunt vitam beatitudinis et veræ lucis.	2. “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. If thou wilt know the truth, believe in Me. If thou wilt be perfect, sell all that thou hast. If thou wilt be My disciple, deny thyself. If thou wouldst possess the blessed life, despise the life which now is. If thou wilt be exalted in heaven, humble thyself in the world. If thou wilt reign with Me, bear the cross with Me; for only the servants of the cross find the way of blessedness and of true light.”
3. Domine Jesu Christe, quia arta erat vita tua, et mundo despecta; dona mihi tecum mundi despectum imitari.Non enim servus est major domino suo, nec discipuus supra magistrum.Exerceatur servus tuus in vita tua, quia ibi est salus mea et sanctitas vera. Quidquid extra eam lego et audio, non me recreat nec delectat plene.	3. O Lord Jesu, forasmuch as Thy life was straitened and despised by the world, grant unto me to imitate Thee in despising the world, for the servant is not greater than his lord, nor the disciple above his master. Let Thy servant be exercised in Thy life, because there is my salvation and true holiness. Whatsoever I read or hear besides it, it refresheth me not, nor giveth me delight.
4. Fili, quia hæc scis et legisti omnia, beatus eris si feceris ea.Qui habet mandata mea et servat ea, ipse estquidiligit me, et ego diligam eum et manifestabo ei meipsumet faciam ipsum consedere mecum in regno Patris mei. Igitur, Domine, sicut dixisti et promisisti, sic utique mihi promereri contingat. Suscepi, suscepi de manu tua crucem: portabo eam usque ad mortem, sicut imposuisti mihi. Vere vita boni Monachi crux est, sed dux paradisi. Inceptum est, retro abire non licet, nec relinquere oportet.	4. “My son, because thou knowest these things and hast read them all, blessed shalt thou be if thou doest them. He who hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him, and I will make him to sit down with Me in My Father’s Kingdom.” O Lord Jesu, as Thou hast said and promised, even so let it be unto me, and grant me to prove worthy. I have received the cross at Thy hand; I have carried it, and will carry it even unto death, as Thou hast laid it upon me. Truly the life of a truly devoted servant is a cross, but it leadeth to paradise. I have begun; I may not return back nor leave it.
5. Eja fratres, pergamus simul: Jesus erit nobiscum; propter Jesum suscepimus hanc crucem; propter Jesum perfeveremus in cruce; erit adjutor noster, qui est dux noster et præcessor. En rex noster ingrediatur ante nos, qui pugnabit pro nobis. Sequamur viriliter, nemo metuat terrores; simus parati mori fortiter in bello, nec inferamus crimen gloriæ nostræ, et fugiamus a cruce.	5. Come, my brothers, let us together go forward. Jesus shall be with us. For Jesus’ sake have we taken up this cross, for Jesus’ sake let us persevere in the cross. He will be our helper, who was our Captain and Forerunner. Behold our King entereth in before us, and He will fight for us. Let us follow bravely, let no man fear terrors; let us be prepared to die bravely in battle, and let us not so stain our honour, as to fly from the cross.
Cap. 57. Quod homo non sit nimis dejectus, quando labitur in aliquos defectus.	CHAPTER LVII That a man must not be too much cast down when he falleth into some faults
1. Fili, magis placent patientia et humilitas in adversis, quam multa consolatio et devotio in prosperis. Ut quid te contristat parvum factum contra te dictum? Si amplius fuisset, commoveri non debuisses. Sed nunc dimitte transire: non est primum nec novum nec ultmum erit, si diu vixeris. Satis virilis es, quamdiu nil obviat adversi; bene etiam consulis et alios nosti roborare verbis: sed cum ad januam tuam venit repentina tribulatio, deficis consilio et robore.	1. “My Son, patience and humility in adversities are more pleasing to Me than much comfort and devotion in prosperity. Why doth a little thing spoken against thee make thee sad? If it had been more, thou still oughtest not to be moved. But now suffer it to go by; it is not the first, it is not new, and it will not be the last, if thou live long. Thou art brave enough, so long as no adversity meeteth thee. Thou givest good counsel also, and knowest how to strengthen others with thy words; but when tribulation suddenly knocketh at thine own door, thy counsel and strength fail. Consider thy great frailty, which thou dost so often experience in trifling matters nevertheless, for thy soul’s health these things are done when they and such like happen unto thee.
2. Attende magnam fragilitatem tuam, quam sæpius experiris in modicis objectis: tamen pro salute tua ista fiunt. Cum hæc et similia contingunt, pone te ut melius nosti ex corde; et si tetigerit tribulatio, non tamen dejiciat nec diue implicet. Ad minus sustine patienter, si non potes gaudenter. Et si minus libenter audis et indignationem sentis, reprime te, nec patiaris aliquid inordinatum ex ore tuo exire, unde parvuli scandalizentur. Cito conquiescet commotio excitata, et dolor internus revertente gratia dulcorabitur. Adhuc vivo ego, dixit Dominus; juvare te paratus sum et solito amplius consolari, si confisus fueris in me, et devote invocaveris me.	2. “Put them away from thy heart as well as thou canst, and if tribulation hath touched thee, yet let it not cast thee down nor entangle thee long. At the least, bear patiently, if thou canst not joyfully. And although thou be very unwilling to hear it, and feel indignation, yet check thyself, and suffer no unadvised word to come forth from thy lips, whereby the little ones may be offended. Soon the storm which hath been raised shall be stilled, and inward grief shall be sweetened by returning grace. I yet live, saith the Lord, ready to help thee, and to give thee more than wonted consolation if thou put thy trust in Me, and call devoutly upon Me.
3. Animæquior esto et ad majorem sustinentiam accingere. Non est totum frustratum, si te sæpius percipis tribulatum vel graviter tentatum. Homo es, et non Deus; caro es, et non Angelus. Quomodo tu posses semper in eodem statu virtutis permanere, quando hoc defuit Angelo in cælo, et primo Homini in paradiso, quid non diu steterunt? Ego sum qui mærentes erigo sospitate, et suam cognoscentes infirmitatem ad meam provoco divinitatem.	3. “Be thou more calm of spirit, and gird thyself for greater endurance. All is not frustrated, though thou find thyself very often afflicted or grievously tempted. Thou art man, not God; thou art flesh, not an angel. How shouldst thou be able to remain alway in the same state of virtue, when an angel in heaven fell, and the first man in paradise? I am He who lifteth up the mourners to deliverance, and those who know their own infirmity I raise up to my own nature.”
4. Domine, benedictum sit verbum tuum,dulce super mel et favumori meo. Quid facerem in tantis tribulationibus et angustiis meis, nisi me confortares tuis sanctis sermonibus? Dummodo tandem ad portum salutis perveniam, quid mihi curæ est, quæ et quanta passus fuero? Da finem bonum et da felicem ex hoc mundo transitum. Memento mei, Deus meus, et dirige me recto itinere in regnum tuum. Amen.	4. O Lord, blessed be Thy word, sweeter to my mouth than honey and the honeycomb. What should I do in my so great tribulations and anxieties, unless Thou didst comfort me with Thy holy words? If only I may attain unto the haven of salvation, what matter is it what things or how many I suffer? Give me a good end, give me a happy passage out of this world. Remember me, O my God, and lead me by the right way unto Thy Kingdom. Amen.
Cap. 58. De altioribus rebus et occultis Dei judiciis non scrutandis.	CHAPTER LVIII Of deeper matters, and God’s hidden judgments which are not to be inquired into
1. Fili, caveas disputare de altis materiis et de occultis Dei judiciis: cur iste sic relinquitur, et ille ad tantam gratiam assumitur? cur etiam iste tantum affligitur, et ille tam eximie exaltatur? Ista omnem facultatem humanam excedunt, nec ad investigandum divum judicium ulla ratio prævalet vel disputatio. Quando ergo hæc tibi suggerit inimicus vel etiam quidam curiosi inquirunt homines, responde illud Prophetæ:Justus es, Domine, et justum judicium tuum; et illud:Judicia Domini vera justificata in semetipsa.Judicia mea metuenda sunt, non discutienda, quia humano intellectua sunt incomprehensibilia.	1. “My Son, beware thou dispute not of high matters and of the hidden judgments of God; why this man is thus left, and that man is taken into so great favour; why also this man is so greatly afflicted, and that so highly exalted. These things pass all man’s power of judging, neither may any reasoning or disputation have power to search out the divine judgments. When therefore the enemy suggesteth these things to thee, or when any curious people ask such questions, answer with that word of the Prophet, Just art Thou, O Lord, and true is Thy judgment , and with this, The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether . My judgments are to be feared, not to be disputed on, because they are incomprehensible to human understanding.
2. Noli etiam inquirere nec disputare de meritis Sanctorum, quis alio sit sanctior; aut quis major sit in regno cælorum. Talia generant sæpe lites et contentiones inutiles, nutriunt quoque superbiam et vanam gloriam: unde oriuntur invidiæ et dissensiones, dum ille istum Sanctum, et alius alium conatur superbe præfferre. Talia autem velle scire et investigare nullum fructum afferunt, sed magis Sanctis displicent, quianon sum Deus dissensionis, sed pacis, quæ pax magis in humilitate vera, quam in propria exaltatione consisit.	2. “And be not given to inquire or dispute about the merits of the Saints, which is holier than another, or which is the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven. Such questions often beget useless strifes and contentions: they also nourish pride and vain glory, whence envyings and dissensions arise, while one man arrogantly endeavoureth to exalt one Saint and another another. But to wish to know and search out such things bringeth no fruit, but it rather displeaseth the Saints; for I am not the God of confusion but of peace;  which peace consisteth more in true humility than in self-exaltation.
3. Quidam zelo devotionis trahuntur ad hos Sanctos vel ad illos, ampliori effectu, sed humano potius, quam divino. Ego sum qui cunctos condidi Sanctos; ego donavi gratiam; ego præstiti gloriam. Ego novi singulorum merita;ego præveni eos in benedictionibus dulcedinismeæ. Ego præscivi dilectos meos ante sæcula;ego eos elegi de mundo,non ipsi me præelegerunt. Ego vocavi per gratiam, attraxi per miscericordiam; ego perduxi eos per tentationes varias. Ego infudi consolationes magnificas; ego dedi perseverantiam; ego coronavi eorum patientiam.	3. “Some are drawn by zeal of love to greater affection to these Saints or those; but this is human affection rather than divine. I am He Who made all the Saints: I gave them grace, I brought them glory; I know the merits of every one; I prevented them with the blessings of My goodness . I foreknew my beloved ones from everlasting, I chose them out of the world;  they did not choose Me. I called them by My grace, drew them by My mercy, led them on through sundry temptations. I poured mighty consolations upon them, I gave them perseverance, I crowned their patience.
4. Ego primum et novissimum agnosco; ego omnes inæstimabili dilectione amplector. Ego laudandus sum in omnibus Sanctis meis; ego super omnia benedicendus sum et honorandus in singulis, quos sic gloriose magnificavi, et prædestinavi sine ullis præcedentibus propriis meritis. Qui ergo unum de minimis meis contemsit, nec magnum honorat:quia pusillum et magnum ego feci.Qui derogat alicui Sanctorum, derogat et mihi, et omnibus cæteris in regno cælorum. Omnes unum sunt per charitatis vinculum, idem sentiunt, idem volunt et omnes in unum se diligunt.	4. “I acknowledge the first and the last; I embrace all with inestimable love. I am to be praised in all My Saints; I am to be blessed above all things, and to be honoured in every one whom I have so gloriously exalted and predestined, without any preceding merits of their own. He therefore that shall despise one of the least of these My people, honoureth not the great; because I made both small and great. And he who speaketh against any of My Saints speaketh against Me, and against all others in the Kingdom of Heaven.” They are all one through the bond of charity; they think the same thing, will  the same thing, and all are united in love one to another.
5. Adhuc autem, quod multo altius est, plus me quam se et sua merita diligunt. Nam supra se rapti et extra propriam dilectionem tracti, toti in amorem meum pergunt, in quo et fruitive quiescunt. Nihil est quod eos avertere possit aut deprimere: quippe qui æterna veritate pleni, igne ardescunt inexstinguibilis charitatis. Taceant igitur carnales et animales homines de Sanctorum statu differere: qui non norunt nisi privata gaudia diligere; demunt et addunt pro sua inclinatione, non prout placet æternæ Veritati.	5. “But yet (which is far better) they love Me above themselves and their own merits. For being caught up above themselves, and drawn beyond self-love, they go all straightforward to the love of Me, and they rest in Me in perfect enjoyment. There is nothing which can turn them away or press them down; for being full of Eternal Truth, they burn with the fire of inextinguishable charity. Therefore let all carnal and natural men hold their peace concerning the state of the Saints, for they know nothing save to love their own personal enjoyment. They take away and add according to their own inclination, not as it pleaseth the Eternal Truth.
6. In multis est ignorantia, eorum maxime qui parum illuminati raro aliquem perfecta dilectione spirituali diligere norunt. Multi adhuc naturali affectu, et humana amicitia ad hos vel ad illos trahuntur; et sicut in inferioribus se habent, ita et de cælestibus imaginantur. Sed est distantia incomparabilis inter ea quæ imperfecti non cognitant, et ea quæ illuminati viri per revelationem contemplantur, et speculantur superna.	6. “In many men this is ignorance, chiefly is it so in those who, being little enlightened, rarely learn to love any one with perfect spiritual love. They are still much drawn by natural affection and human friendship to these or to those: and as they reckon of themselves in lower matters, so also do they frame imaginations of things heavenly. But there is an immeasurable difference between those things which they imperfectly imagine, and these things which enlightened men behold through supernatural revelation.
7. Cave ergo, fili, de istis curiose tractare, quæ scientiam tuam excedunt; sed hoc magis satage et intende, ut vel minimus in regno Dei queas inveniri. Et si quispiam sciret, quis alio sanctior esset, vel major haberetur in regno cælorum, quid ei hæc notitia prodesset, nisi se ex hac cognitione coram me humliaret, et in majorem mei nominis laudem exsurgeret? Multo acceptius Deo facit qui de peccatorum suorum magnitudine, et virtutum suarum parvitate cogitat, et quam longe a Sanctorum perfectione distat, quam is, qui de majoritate eorum vel parvitate disputat. Melius est Sanctos devotis precibus et lacrymis exorare et eorum gloriosa suffragia humili mente implicare, quam eorum secreta vana inquisitione perscrutari.	7. “Take heed, therefore, My son, that thou treat not curiously those things which surpass thy knowledge, but rather make this thy business and give attention to it, namely, that thou seek to be found, even though it be the least, in the Kingdom of God. And even if any one should know who were holier than others, or who were held greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven; what should that knowledge profit him, unless through this knowledge he should humble himself before Me, and should rise up to give greater praise unto My name? He who considereth how great are his own sins, how small his virtues, and how far he is removed from the perfection of the Saints, doeth far more acceptably in the sight of God, than he who disputeth about their greatness or littleness.
8. Illi bene et optime contentantur, si homines scirent contentari et vaniloquia sua compescere. Non gloriantur de propriis meritis, quippe qui sibi nil bonitatis adscribunt; sed totum mihi, quoniam ipsis cuncta ex infinita mea charitate donavi. Tanto amore divinitatis et gaudio supereffluenti replentur, ut nil desit eis gloriæ, nihilque desit felicitatis. Omnes Sancti quanto altiores in gloria tanto humiliores in se ipsis, et mihi viciniores et dilectiores existunt. Ideoque habes scriptum, quiamittebant coronas suas ante Deum, et ceciderunt in facies suas coram Agno et adoraverunt viventem in sæcula sæculorum.	8. “They are altogether well content, if men would learn to be content, and to refrain from vain babbling. They glory not of their own merits, seeing they ascribe no good unto themselves, but all unto Me, seeing that I of my infinite charity have given them all things. They are filled with so great love of the Divinity, and with such overflowing joy, that no glory is lacking to them, neither can any felicity be lacking. All the Saints, the higher they are exalted in glory, the humbler are they in themselves, and the nearer and dearer are they unto Me. And so thou hast it written that they cast their crowns before God and fell on their faces before the Lamb, and worshipped Him that liveth for ever and ever. 
9. Multi quærunt, quis major sit in regno Dei, qui ignorant an cum minimis erunt digni computari. Magnum est vel esse minimum in cælo, ubi omnes magni sunt: quia omnes filii Dei vocabuntur et erunt.Minimus erit in mille et peccator centum annorum morietur.Cum enim quærerent Discipuli, quis major esset in regno cælorum, tale audierunt responsum:Nisi conversi fueritis et efficiamini sicut parvuli, non intrabitis in regnum cælorum. Quicumque ergo humiliaverit se sicut parvulus iste: hic major est in regno cælorum.	9. “Many ask who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, who know not whether they shall be worthy to be counted among the least. It is a great thing to be even the least in Heaven, where all are great, because all shall be called, and shall be, the sons of God. A little one shall become a thousand, but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed . For when the disciples asked who should be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven , they received no other answer than this, Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. But whosoever shall humble himself as this little child, the same shall be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .”
10. Væ eis, qui cum parvulis se humiliare sponte dedignantur, quoniam humilis janua regni cælestis eos non admittet intrare.Væetdivitibus, qui habent consolationes suashic, quia pauperibus intrantibus in regnum Dei, ipsi stabunt foris ejulantes. Gaudete humiles, et exultate pauperes, quia vestrum est regnum Dei, si tamen in veritate ambulatis.	10. Woe unto them who disdain to humble themselves willingly with the little children; for the low gate of the kingdom of Heaven will not suffer them to enter in. Woe also to them who are rich, who have their consolation here; because whilst the poor enter into the kingdom of God, they shall stand lamenting without. Rejoice ye humble, and exult ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God if only ye walk in the truth.
Cap. 59. Quod omnis spes et fiducia in solo Deo et figenda.	CHAPTER LIX That all hope and trust is to be fixed in God alone
1. Domine, quæ est fiducia mea quam in hac vita habeo, aut quod majus solatium meum ex omnibus apparentibus sub cælo? Nonne tu, Domine Deus meus, cujus misericordiæ non est numerus? Ubi mihi bene fuit sine te? Aut quando male esse potuit præsente te? Malo pauper esse propter te, quam dives sine te. Eligo potius tecum in terra peregrainari, quam sine te cælum possidere. Ubi tu, ibi cælum; atque ibi mors est atque infernus, ubi tu non es. Tu mihi in desiderio es, et ideo post te gemere et clamare et exorare necesse est. In nullo denique possum plene considere, qui in necessitatibus auxilietur opportunius, nisi in te solo Deo meo. Tu es spes mea, et fiducia mea, et consolator meus, et fidelissimus in omnibus.	1. O Lord, what is my trust which I have in this life, or what is my greatest comfort of all the things which are seen under Heaven? Is it not Thou, O Lord my God, whose mercies are without number? Where hath it been well with me without Thee? Or when could it be evil whilst Thou wert near? I had rather be poor for Thy sake, than rich without Thee. I choose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with Thee than without Thee to possess heaven. Where Thou art, there is heaven; and where Thou are not, behold there death and hell. Thou art all my desire, and therefore must I groan and cry and earnestly pray after Thee. In short I can confide fully in none to give me ready help in necessities, save in Thee alone, O my God. Thou art my hope, Thou art my trust, Thou art my Comforter, and most faithful in all things.
2. Omnes quæ sua sunt quærunt; tu salutem meam, et profectum meum solummodo prætendis et omnia in bonum mihi convertis. Et si variis tentationibus et adversitatibus exponas me, hoc totum ad utilitatem meam ordinas, qui mille modis dilectos tuos probare consuevisti. In qua probatione non minus diligi debes et laudari, quam si cælestibus consolationibus me repleres.	2. All men seek their own;  Thou settest forward only my salvation and my profit, and turnest all things unto my good. Even though Thou dost expose me to divers temptations and adversities, Thou ordainest all this unto my advantage, for Thou are wont to prove Thy beloved ones in a thousand ways. In which proving Thou oughtest no less to be loved and praised, than if Thou wert filling me full of heavenly consolations.
3. In te ergo, Domine Deus meus, pono totam spem meam et refugium; in te omnem tribulationem meam et angustiam meam constituo, quia totum infirumum et instabile invenio quidquid extra te conspicio. Non enim proderunt multi amici, neque fortes auxiliarii adjuvare poterunt, neque prudentes consiliarii responsum utile dare, neque libri Doctorum consolari, nec alia prætiosa substantia liberare, neque locus aliquis secretus contutari, si tu ipse non assistas, juves, confortes, consoleris, instruas et custodias.	3. In Thee, therefore, O Lord God, I put all my hope and my refuge, on Thee I lay all my tribulation and anguish; because I find all to be weak and unstable whatsoever I behold out of Thee. For many friends shall not profit, nor strong helpers be able to succour, nor prudent counsellors to give a useful answer, nor the books of the learned to console, nor any precious substance to deliver, nor any secret and beautiful place to give shelter, if Thou Thyself do not assist, help, strengthen, comfort, instruct, keep in safety.
4. Omnia namque, quæ ad pacem videntur esse et felicitatem habendam, te absente nihil sunt, nihilque felicitatis et veritate conferunt. Finis ergo omnium bonorum et altitudo vitæ et profunditas eloquiorum tu es; et in te super omnia sperare, fortissimum solatium omnium servorum tuorum. Ad te sunt oculi mei; in te confido, Deus meus; misericordiarum Pater, benedic et sanctifica animam meam benedictione cælesti, ut fiat habitatio sancta tua et sedes æternæ gloriæ tuæ, nihilque in templo tuæ dignitatis inveniatur, quod oculos tuæ majestatis offendat.Secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarumet magnitudinem bonitatis tuærespice in me,et exaudi orationem pauperis servi tui, longe exulantis in regione umbræ mortis. Protege et conserva animam servuli tui inter tot discrimina vitæ corruptibilis, ac comitante gratia tua, dirige per viam pacis ad perpetuæ patriam felicitatis et claritatis.	4. For all things which seem to belong to the attainment of peace and felicity are nothing when Thou art absent, and bring no felicity at all in reality. Therefore art Thou the end of all good, and the fulness of Life, and the soul of eloquence; and to hope in Thee above all things is the strongest solace of Thy servants. Mine eyes look unto Thee , in Thee is my trust, O my God, Father of mercies. Bless and sanctify my soul with heavenly blessing that it may become Thy holy habitation, and the seat of Thy eternal glory; and let nothing be found in the Temple of Thy divinity which may offend the eyes of Thy majesty. According to the greatness of Thy goodness and the multitude of Thy mercies look upon me, and hear the prayer of Thy poor servant, far exiled from Thee in the land of the shadow of death. Protect and preserve the soul of Thy least servant amid so many dangers of corruptible life, and by Thy grace accompanying me, direct it by the way of peace unto its home of perpetual light.
