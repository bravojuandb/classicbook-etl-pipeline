# Daily Log – April 15, 2025

## Exploring `pathlib`
- Began integrating the `pathlib` module into existing scripts for cleaner, OS-independent file handling.
- Planned to refactor all file-related code in the pipeline to use `Path` objects instead of hardcoded strings.

## Script Development
- Continued working on `clean_bookI.py`, focusing on:
  - Removing unnecessary formatting
  - Handling paragraph breaks
  - Preparing aligned Latin-English text for SQL insertion

## Folder & Repo Clean-Up
- Reorganized the folder structure for clarity and long-term scalability.
- Ensured all data and script files are in their appropriate subdirectories (`extract_phase/`, `transform_phase/`, etc.).

## Documentation
- Added “Key Principles” to `README.md`on how to make a good Batch Pipeline
- These principles will guide coding and design decisions throughout the pipeline.

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Renamed `clean_aligned_books.py` to `clean_bookII.py`
- Moved `pathlib_cheat_sheet.md` to `docs/`

## 🔄 Git Issue Faced

- Push was rejected due to remote changes not being pulled
- Git warned: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"
- I had local uncommitted changes (README and file deletions)

## 🛠️ How I Solved It

1. Staged all local changes with `git add -u`
2. Committed with message: `"chore: sync local changes (README and deletions) before rebase"`
3. Rebased with `git pull origin main --rebase`
4. Pushed successfully: `git push origin main`

## 📦 Final Status

- Working tree clean ✅
- All local changes reflected on GitHub
- Transform phase continuing with Book II script (`clean_bookII.py`)
