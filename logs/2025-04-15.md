# Daily Log – April 15, 2025

## Exploring `pathlib`
- Began integrating the `pathlib` module into existing scripts for cleaner, OS-independent file handling.
- Planned to refactor all file-related code in the pipeline to use `Path` objects instead of hardcoded strings.

## Script Development
- Continued working on `clean_bookI.py`, focusing on:
  - Removing unnecessary formatting
  - Handling paragraph breaks
  - Preparing aligned Latin-English text for SQL insertion

## Folder & Repo Clean-Up
- Reorganized the folder structure for clarity and long-term scalability.
- Ensured all data and script files are in their appropriate subdirectories (`extract_phase/`, `transform_phase/`, etc.).

## Documentation
- Added “Key Principles” to `README.md`on how to make a good Batch Pipeline
- These principles will guide coding and design decisions throughout the pipeline.
