### Project Log — April 17, 2025

#### Updates Completed

1. **Manual Alignment of Books III and IV**
   - Added aligned Latin-English `.tsv` files for:
     - `book3_aligned.tsv`
     - `book4_aligned.tsv`
   - These files follow the same column structure as previous aligned books and were stored under `processed_data/aligned/` (now migrated to `data/aligned/`).

2. **Cleaning Script Creation**
   - Created two new cleaning scripts:
     - `clean_bookIII.py`
     - `clean_bookIV.py`
   - Each script loads its respective aligned `.tsv` file, applies preprocessing steps, and exports the output to the cleaned data folder (`data/cleaned/`).

3. **Folder Structure Refactor**
   - Reorganized the entire project to improve maintainability:
     - All data files are now housed under a single `data/` folder:
       - Includes `raw/`, `aligned/`, `cleaned/`, and `templates/` subfolders.
     - All scripts moved to a unified `scripts/` folder:
       - Organized into `extract/`, `transform/`, and future `load/` sections.

4. **Version Control**
   - All changes were committed with descriptive messages and pushed to the remote `main` branch on GitHub.

#### Plan Ahead

- **Unified Cleaning Pipeline**
  - Goal: Create a single script (`clean_imitation.py`) to:
    - Load all four aligned `.tsv` books
    - Apply a consistent cleaning process
    - Output a master file: `Imitation_Cleaned.tsv`
  - Purpose: Produce a full, clean, Latin-English corpus of *The Imitation of Christ* for deeper analysis or ETL integration.

#### Reflection from The Imitation of Christ

“Omne opus tuum fideliter et studiose fac, quia operis fructum postea videbis.”
“Do all your work faithfully and diligently, for in time you shall see the fruit of your labor.”
