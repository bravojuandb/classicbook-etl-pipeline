## Project Milestone

**Transitioning from Extract to Load phase (Book-by-Book Strategy)**

## Reflections
Today, I decided to shift the approach to the loading phase of the project. I‚Äôve been manually aligning the Latin and English texts of *The Imitation of Christ* and exporting the aligned results into TSV format. This task, though beautiful, has proven to be extremely tedious and time-consuming. I have completed the alignment for:

- üìñ Book 1
- üìñ Book 2

Book 3 is halfway done, and Book 4 remains to be aligned. However, rather than waiting until all four books are complete, I‚Äôve chosen to **begin loading each book individually** into PostgreSQL. This allows me to alternate between manual alignment and SQL loading, avoiding burnout and enabling visible progress on multiple fronts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status
- ‚úÖ Latin text fully extracted
- ‚úÖ English text fully extracted
- ‚úÖ Aligned TSV files complete for Book 1 and Book 2
- ‚úÖ Extract scripts for both languages are functional
- üß≠ Loading stage begins with Book 1

## Sample Aligned Data (Book 1)
| Paragraph | Latin Text | English Text |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Cap. I. | De imitatione Christi et contemptu mundi omniumque eius vanitatum. | Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities |
| 1 | Qui sequitur me non ambulat in tenebris... | He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness... |
| 2 | Doctrina Ejus omnes doctrinas Sanctorum praecellit... | His teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men... |

The data is aligned in paragraph units and is formatted in a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format for simplicity and compatibility.

## Transformation Thoughts
I believe the aligned TSV files are already in a ‚Äútransformed‚Äù state‚Äîclean and structured for loading. However, as I begin to create SQL tables, I will verify whether further cleaning or normalization is needed (e.g., trimming whitespace, verifying encoding, standardizing paragraph IDs).

##  Next Step
- Design SQL schema for Book 1
- Create table and load Book 1 into PostgreSQL
- Continue aligning Book 3 as time allows
