## Progress Summary

- **Renamed project folder** from `classicbook_etl_pipeline` to `classicbook-etl-pipeline` for consistency.

- **Removed and recreated virtual environment** with the correct path:
  - Created new `venv/` inside the renamed folder.
  - Activated it and reinstalled dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Updated `pip` to version `25.0.1`.

- **Verified and successfully ran** `extract_english.py`:
  - Fetched HTML content from Project Gutenberg.
  - Extracted **903 paragraphs**.
  - Saved output to: `raw_data/english_kempis.txt`.

- **Added commit messages**:
  - For new extraction script.
  - For the top-level docstring.
  - For the extracted text file.

- **Clarified Git commit message styles** (`feat`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.).

- **Created and added a professional top-level docstring** to `extract_latin.py`.

- Now have two raw text files: Latin (674 paragraphs) and English (900+ paragraphs).
- Decided to align texts manually, using the Latin as the reference due to its clearer structure.
- Manual alignment is time-consuming but necessary to ensure accuracy.

- **Next**
- Start aligning both texts manually.
- Create combine_texts.py to generate a bilingual .tsv.
- Prepare for database loading.
