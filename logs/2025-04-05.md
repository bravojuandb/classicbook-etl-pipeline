##  Focus
- Continue building the ETL pipeline for *The Imitation of Christ*
- Finalize setup for `extract_english.py`
- Use environment variables for portable paths

---

## What I Did

_ Set up the README file for the whole project
- Created the initial version of `extract_english.py`
- Used `os.getenv()` to make paths portable across systems
- Learned about and applied `feat:` commits for scripts in progress
- Learned about and applied `doc:` commits for documentation
- Committed the English extract script to GitHub

## Reflection

- Attempted full English text extraction from ccel.org
- Script became too complex (guessing URLs, regex, session handling)
- Encountered memory errors and rate limits
- Decided to abandon CCEL and switch to Project Gutenberg (HTML version)
- Plan: use simpler scrape and save text directly to file
