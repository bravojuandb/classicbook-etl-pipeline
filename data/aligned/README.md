# Aligned Data

This folder contains the four books of *The Imitation of Christ*, manually aligned using the template file `latin_alignment_template.csv`.

## Why Manual Alignment?

The standard division of chapters and paragraphs in the English translation did not consistently match the original Latin text. For instance, some chapters in English contained fewer numbered paragraphs than their Latin counterpartsâ€”even though both conveyed the same content.

To ensure high fidelity between the two versions, I chose to align the texts manually. While this process is time-consuming, it guarantees accuracy.

This project is not only part of my data engineering portfolio, but also a personal tool I intend to use and maintain. Therefore, prioritizing accuracy over speed was essential.
