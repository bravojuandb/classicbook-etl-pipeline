Liber Secundus: Admonitiones ad interna trahentes.	THE SECOND BOOK: ADMONITIONS CONCERNING THE INNER LIFE
Cap. I.  Incipit liber de interna conversationes.	CHAPTER I Of the inward life
1.Regnum Dei intra vos est,dicit Dominus. Converte te ex toto corde tuo ad Dominum, et relinque hunc miserum mundum, et inveniet anima tua requiem. Disce exteriora contemnere et ad interiora te dare, et videbis regnum Dei intra te venire.Est enim regnum Dei pax et gaudium in Spiritu Sanctoquod non datur impiis. Veniet ad te Christus ostendens tibi consolatinem suam, si dignam illi ab intus paraveris mansionem. Omnis gloria ejus et decor ab intra est, et ibi complacet sibi. Frequens illi visitatio cum homine interno, dulcis sermocinatio, grata consolatio, multa pax, familiaritas stupenda nimis.	1. The kingdom of God is within you, saith the Lord. Turn thee with all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable world, and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul. Learn to despise outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee. For the kingdom of God is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and it is not given to the wicked. Christ will come to thee, and show thee His consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him within thee. All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it pleaseth Him to dwell. He often visiteth the inward man and holdeth with him sweet discourse, giving him soothing consolation, much peace, friendship exceeding wonderful.
2. Eya anima fidelis, præpara huic sponso cor tuum, quatenus ad te venire et in te habitare dignetur. Sic enim dicit:Si quis diligit me, sermonem meum servabit, et ad eum veniemus, et mansionem apud eum faciemus.Da ergo Christo locum et cæteris omnibus nega introitum. Cum Christum habueris, dives es, et sufficit tibi. Ipse erit provisor tuus, et fidelis procurator in omnibus, ut non fit opus in hominibus sparare. Homines enim cito mutantur, et deficiunt velociter, Christus autem manet in æternum, et adstat usque in finem firmiter.	2. Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom that he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for so He saith, if any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. Give, therefore, place to Christ and refuse entrance to all others. When thou hast Christ, thou art rich, and hast sufficient. He shall be thy provider and faithful watchman in all things, so that thou hast no need to trust in men, for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ remaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end.
3. Non est magna fiducia ponenda in homine fragili et mortali, etiamsi utilis fit et dilectus, neque tristitia multa capienda ex hoc, si interdum adversetur et contradicat. Qui hodie tecum sunt, cras contrariari possunt. Et e converso sæpe ut aura vertuntur. Pone fiduciam tuam totam in Domino; et sit ipse timor tuus, et amor tuus. Ipse pro te respondebit, et faciet bene sicut melius fuerit. Nonhabes hic manentem civitatem, et ubicumque fueris, extraneus es et peregrinus, nec requiem aliquando habebis, nisi Christo intime fueris unitus.	3. There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal man, even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict us. They who are on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against thee, and often are they turned round like the wind. Put thy whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear and thy love, He will answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee what is best. Here hast thou no continuing city, and wheresoever thou art, thou art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have rest unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.
4. Quid hic circumspicis, cum iste non sit locus tuæ requietonis? In cælestibus debet esse habitatio tua et sicut in transitu cuncta sunt aspicienda. Transeunt omnia, et tu cum eis pariter. Vide, ut non hæreas, ne capiaris, et pereas. Apud Altissimum sit cogitatio tua, et deprecatio tua ad Christum sine intermissione dirigatur. Si nescis alta speculari et cælestia, requiesce in passione Christi, et in sacris vulneribus ejus libenter habita. Si enim ad vulnera et speciosa stigmata Jesu devote confugis, magnam in tribulatione senties consolationem, nec multum curabis hominum despectiones faciliterque verba detrahentium perferes.	4. Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this is not the place of thy rest? In heaven ought thy habitation to be, and all earthly things should be looked upon as it were in the passing by. All things pass away and thou equally with them. Look that thou cleave not to them lest thou be taken with them and perish. Let thy contemplation be on the Most High, and let thy supplication be directed unto Christ without ceasing. If thou canst not behold high and heavenly things, rest thou in the passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred wounds. For if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the precious marks of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great comfort in tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much, and thou wilt easily bear their unkind words.
5. Jesus Christus Dominus fuit etiam in mundo ab hominibus despectus, et in maxima necessitate, a notis et amicis inter opprobria derelictus. Dominus Jesus pati voluit et despici, et tu audes de aliquo conqueri? Christus habuit adversarios et oblocutores, et tu vis omnes habere amicos, et benefactores? Ubi coronabitur patentia tua, si nihil adversitatis occurrit. Si nihil contrarium vis pati, quomodo eris amicus Christi? Sustine cum Christo et pro Christo, si vis regare cum Christo.	5. Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and rejected of men, and in His greatest necessity was left by His acquaintance and friends to bear these reproaches. Christ was willing to suffer and be despised, and darest thou complain of any? Christ had adversaries and gainsayers, and dost thou wish to have all men thy friends and benefactors? Whence shall thy patience attain her crown if no adversity befall thee? If thou art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt thou be the friend of Christ? Sustain thyself with Christ and for Christ if thou wilt reign with Christ.
6. Si semel perfecte introisses in interiora Jesu, et modicum de ardenti amore ejus sapuisses, tunc de proprio commodo, vel incommodo nihil curares, sed magis de opprobrio illato gauderes, quia amor Jesu facit hominem se ipsum contemnere. Amator Jesu et verus internus, et liber ab affectionibus inordinatis, potest se ad Deum libere convertere, et elevare se supra se ipsum in spiritu ac fruitive quiescere.	6. If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst tasted yea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou care nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience, but wouldst rather rejoice at trouble brought upon thee, because the love of Jesus maketh a man to despise himself. He who loveth Jesus, and is inwardly true and free from inordinate affections, is able to turn himself readily unto God, and to rise above himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful peace.
7. Cui sapiunt omnia prout sunt non ut dicuntur, aut æstimantur, hic vere sapiens est, et doctus a Deo magis, quam ab hominibus. Qui ab intra scit ambulare et modicum res ab extra ponderare, non reqirit loca, nec tempora expectat ad habenda devota exercitia. Homo internus cito se recolligit, et nunquam se totum ad exteriora effundit. Non illi obest labor exterior, aut occupatio ad tempus necessaria. Sed sicut res eveniunt, sic se illis accommodat. Qui intus bene dispositus est et ordinatus, non curat mirabiles et perversos hominum gestus. Tantum homo impeditur, et distrahitur, quantum sibi res attrahit.	7. He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of men. He who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little value upon outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for seasons, for holding his intercourse with God. The inward man quickly recollecteth himself, because he is never entirely given up to outward things. No outward labour and no necessary occupations stand in his way, but as events fall out, so doth he fit himself to them. He who is rightly disposed and ordered within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of men. A man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by outward things.
8. Si recte tibi esses, et bene purgatus esses, omnia tibi in bonum cederent, et profectum. Ideo multa tibi sæpe displicent et sæpe conturbant, quia adhuc non es perfecte tibi mortuus, nec segregatus ab omnibus terrenis. Nihil sic maculat et implicat cor hominis, sicut impurus amor in creaturis. Si renuis consolari exterius, poteris speculari cælestia, et frequenter interius jubilare.	8. If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil, all things would work together for thy good and profiting. For this cause do many things displease thee and often trouble thee, that thou art not yet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated from all earthly things. Nothing so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as impure love towards created things. If thou rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to contemplate heavenly things and frequently to be joyful inwardly.
Cap. 2. De submissione, Prælati regimine.	CHAPTER II Of lowly submission
1. Non magni pendas qui pro te vel contra te fit, sed hoc age, et cura, ut Deus tecum sit in omni re quam facis. Habeas conscientiam bonam, et Deus bene te defensabit. Quem enim adjuvare voluerit, nullius perversitas nocere poterit. Si tu sci tacere et pati, videbis proculdubio auxilium Domini. Ipse novit tempus, et modum liberandi te, et idea debes te illi resignare. Dei est adjuvare, et ab omni confusione liberare. sæpe valde prodest ad majorem humilitatem conservandam, quod defectus nostros alii sciunt, et redarguunt.	1. Make no great account who is for thee or against thee, but mind only the present duty and take care that God be with thee in whatsoever thou doest. Have a good conscience and God will defend thee, for he whom God will help no man’s perverseness shall be able to hurt. If thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the help of the Lord. He knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee, therefore must thou resign thyself to Him. To God it belongeth to help and to deliver from all confusion. Oftentimes it is very profitable for keeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our faults.
2. Quando pro defectibus suis se humiliat, tunc faciliter alios placat, et leviter satisfacit sibi irascentibus. Humilem Deus protegit, et liberat. Humilem diligit, et consolatur. Humili homini se inclinat. Humili largitur gratiam plenam et magnam. Et post suam depressionem levat ad gloriam. Humili sua secreta revelat, et ad se dulciter trahit, et invitat. Humilis accepta contumelia et confusione satis bene est in pace, quia stat in Deo, et non in mundo. Non reputes te aliquid profecisse, nisi omnibus te inferiorem esse sentias.	2. When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered against him. God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He loveth and comforteth the humble man, to the humble man He inclineth Himself, on the humble He bestoweth great grace, and when he is cast down He raiseth him to glory: to the humble He revealeth His secrets, and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to Himself. The humble man having received reproach, is yet in sufficient peace, because he resteth on God and not on the world. Reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel thyself to be inferior to all.
Cap. 3. De bono pacifico homine.	HAPTER III Of the good, peaceable man
1. Pone te primus in pace, et tunc alios poteris pacificare. Homo pacificus plus prodest, quam bene doctus. Homo passionatus etiam bonus in malum trahit, et faciliter malum credit. Bonus homo pacificus omnia ad bonum convertit. Qui bene in pace est, de nullo suspicatur. Qui autem male contentus est, et commotus, variis suspicionibus agitatur, nec ipse quiescit, nec alios quiescere permittit. Dicit sæpe quod sibi magis facere expediret, et negligit, quod ipse facere tenetur. Habe ergo primum zelum super te ipsum, tunc zelare poteris etiam juste proximum tuum.	1. First keep thyself in peace, and then shalt thou be able to be a peacemaker towards others. A peaceable man doth more good than a well-learned. A passionate man turneth even good into evil and easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all things into good. He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to be quiet. He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth what it were more expedient for him to do. He considereth to what duties others are bound, and neglecteth those to which he is bound himself. Therefore be zealous first over thyself, and then mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour.
2. Tu bene facta scis excusare, et tolerare, et aliorum non vis accipere excusationes. Justus esses, si te accusares, et fratrem tuum excusares. Si portari vis, porta alium. Vide quam longe es adhuc a vera charitate, et humilitate, quæ nuli novit indignarei vel irasci, nisi tantum sibi ipsi. Non est magnum cum bonis, et mansuetis conversari. Hoc enim omnibus naturaliter placet, et unusquisque libenter pacem habet, et secum sentientes magis diligit. Sed cum duris, et perversis aut indisciplinatis aut nobis contrariantibus pacifice posse vivere, magna gratia est, et laudabile nimis virileque factum.	2. Thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds, but thou wilt not accept the excuses of others. It would be more just to accuse thyself and excuse thy brother. If thou wilt that others bear with thee, bear thou with others. Behold how far thou art as yet from the true charity and humility which knows not how to be angry or indignant against any save self alone. It is no great thing to mingle with the good and the meek, for this is naturally pleasing to all, and every one of us willingly enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who think with us: but to be able to live peaceably with the hard and perverse, or with the disorderly, or those who oppose us, this is a great grace and a thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man.
3. Sed sunt qui se ipsos in pace tenent, et cum aliis etiam pacem habent. Et sunt qui nec pacem habent, nec alios in pace dimittunt. Aliis sunt graves, sed sibi sunt semper graviores. Et sunt qui se ipsos in pace retinent, et ad pacem alios reducere student. Et tamen tota pax nostra in hac misera vita potius in humili sufferentia ponenda est, quam in non sentiendo contraria? Qui melius scit pati, pacem tenebit maiorem. Iste est victor fui, et dominus mundi, amicus Christi, et hæres cæli.	3. There are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also with others, and there are who neither have peace nor suffer others to have peace; they are troublesome to others, but always more troublesome to themselves. And there are who hold themselves in peace, and study to bring others unto peace; nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life lieth in humble suffering rather than in not feeling adversities. He who best knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace; that man is conqueror of himself and lord of the world, the friend of Christ, and the inheritor of heaven.
Cap. 4. De pura mente et simplici intentione.	CHAPTER IV Of a pure mind and simple intention
1. Duabus alis homo sublevatur a terrenis, scilicet simplicitate et puritate. Simplicitas debet esse in intentione, puritas in affectione. Simplicitas intendit deum, puritas apprehendit et gustat. Nulla actio te impediet, si liber intus ab omni inordinato affectu fueris. Si nihil aliud quam Dei beneplacitum, et proximi utilitatem intendis et quæris, interna libertate frueris. Si rectum cor tuum esset, tunc omnis creatura speculum vitæ, et liber sanctæ doctrinæ esset. Non est creatura tam parva et vilis quæ bonitatem Dei non repræsentet.	1. By two wings is man lifted above earthly things, even by simplicity and purity. Simplicity ought to be in the intention, purity in the affection. Simplicity reacheth towards God, purity apprehendeth Him and tasteth Him. No good action will be distasteful to thee if thou be free within from inordinate affection. If thou reachest after and seekest, nothing but the will of God and the benefit of thy neighbour, thou wilt entirely enjoy inward liberty. If thine heart were right, then should every creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine. There is no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the goodness of God.
2. Si tu esses intus bonus, et purus, tunc omnia sine impedimento, et caperes bene. Cor purum penetrat cælum, et infernum. Qualis unusquisque est intus, taliter iudicat exterius. Si est gaudium in mundo, hoc utique possidet cordis puri homo. Et si est alicubi tribulatio et angustia, hoc melius novit mala conscientia. Sicut ferrum missum in ignem amittit rubiginem et totum candens efficitur, sic homo ad Deum integre se convertens, a torpore exuitur, et in novum hominem transmutatur.	2. If thou wert good and pure within, then wouldst thou look upon all things without hurt and understand them aright. A pure heart seeth the very depths of heaven and hell. Such as each one is inwardly, so judgeth he outwardly. If there is any joy in the world surely the man of pure heart possesseth it, and if there is anywhere tribulation and anguish, the evil conscience knoweth it best. As iron cast into the fire loseth rust and is made altogether glowing, so the man who turneth himself altogether unto God is freed from slothfulness and changed into a new man.
3. Quando homo incipit tepescere, tunc parvum metuit laborem, et externam accipit consolationem. Sed quando perfecte incipit se vincere, et viriliter in via Dei ambulare, tunc minus ea reputat, quæ sibi prius gravia esse sentiebat.	3. When a man beginneth to grow lukewarm, then he feareth a little labour, and willingly accepteth outward consolation; but when he beginneth perfectly to conquer himself and to walk manfully in the way of God, then he counteth as nothing those things which aforetime seemed to be so grievous unto him.
Cap. 5. De propria consideratione.	CHAPTER V Of self-esteem
1. Non possumus nobis ipsis nimis credere, quia sæpe gratia nobis deest, modicum lumen est in nobis, et hoc cito per negligentiam amittimus. Sæpe etiam non advertimus, quod tam cæci intus sumus. Sæpe male agimus, et peius excusamus. Et passione interdum movemur, et zelum putamus. Parva in aliis reprehendimus, et nostra maiora pertransimus. Satis cito persentimus et ponderamus quid ab aliis sustinemus; sed quantum alii de nobis sustinent, non advertimus. Qui bene et recte sua ponderaret, non esset quid de alio graviter iudicaret.	1. We cannot place too little confidence in ourselves, because grace and understanding are often lacking to us. Little light is there within us, and what we have we quickly lose by negligence. Oftentimes we perceive not how great is our inward blindness. We often do ill and excuse it worse. Sometimes we are moved by passion and count it zeal; we blame little faults in others and pass over great faults in ourselves. Quickly enough we feel and reckon up what we bear at the hands of others, but we reflect not how much others are bearing from us. He who would weigh well and rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of another.
2. Internus homo sui ipsius curam omnibus curis anteponit: et qui sibi ipsi diligenter intendit, faciliter de aliis tacet. Nunquam eris internus et devotus, nisi de aliis silueris et ad te ipsum specialiter respexeris. Si tibi ipsi et Deo totaliter intendis, modicum te movebit, quod foris percipis. Ubi es, quando tibi ipsi præsens non es? Et quando omnia percurristi, quid te neglecto profecisti? Si debes habere pacem et unionem veram, oportet, quod totum adhuc postponas et te solum præ oculis habeas.	2. The spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all cares; and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth silence concerning others. Thou wilt never be spiritually minded and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men’s matters and take full heed to thyself. If thou think wholly upon thyself and upon God, what thou seest out of doors shall move thee little. Where art thou when thou art not present to thyself? and when thou hast overrun all things, what hath it profited thee, thyself being neglected? If thou wouldst have peace and true unity, thou must put aside all other things, and gaze only upon thyself.
3. Multum proinde proficies, si te seriatum ab omni temporali cura conserves. Valde deficies, si aliquid temporale reputaveris. Nihil altum, nihil magnum, nihil gratum, nihil acceptum tibi sit, nisi pure Deus, aut de Deo sit. Totum vanum exstima, quidquid consolationis occurrit de aliqua creatura. Amans Deum anima sub Deo contemnit, despicit universa.  Solus Deus æternus et immensus, implens omnia, solatium est animæ et vera mentis lætitia.	3. Then thou shalt make great progress if thou keep thyself free from all temporal care. Thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou set a value upon any worldly thing. Let nothing be great, nothing high, nothing pleasing, nothing acceptable unto thee, save God Himself or the things of God. Reckon as altogether vain whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature. The soul that loveth God looketh not to anything that is beneath God. God alone is eternal and incomprehensible, filling all things, the solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart.
Cap. 6. De lætitia bonæ conscientiæ	CHAPTER VI Of the joy of a good conscience
1. Gloria bonis hominibus testimonium bonæ conscientiæ. Habe bonam conscientiam et semper habebis lætitiam. Bona conscientia valde multa potest portare, et valde læta est inter adversa. Mala conscientia semper timida, et inquieta. Suaviter requiesces, si te cor tuum non reprehenderit. Noli lætari, nisi cum benefeceris. Mali nunquam habent veram lætitiam, nec internam sentiunt pacem, quianon est pax impiis, dicit Dominus.Et si dixerint: in pace sumus, non venient super nos mala; et quis nobis nocere audebit? non credas eis, quoniam repente exsurget ira Dei, et in nihilum redigentur actus eorum, et cogitationes eorum peribunt.	1. The testimony of a good conscience is the glory of a good man. Have a good conscience and thou shalt ever have joy. A good conscience is able to bear exceeding much, and is exceeding joyful in the midst of adversities; an evil conscience is ever fearful and unquiet. Thou shalt rest sweetly if thy heart condemn thee not. Never rejoice unless when thou hast done well. The wicked have never true joy, nor feel internal peace, for there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. And if they say “we are in peace, there shall no harm happen unto us, and who shall dare to do us hurt?” believe them not, for suddenly shall the wrath of God rise up against them, and their deeds shall be brought to nought, and their thoughts shall perish.
2.Gloriari in tribulationibusnon est grave amanti, Sic enim gloriari estin cruce Domini gloriari.Brevis gloria quæ ab hominibus datur et accipitur. Mundi gloriam semper comitatur tristitia. Bonorum gloria in conscientiis eorum, et non in ore hominum. Justorum lætitia de Deo et in Deo est, et gaudium eorum de veritate. Qui veram et æternam gloriam desiderat, temporalem non curat. Et qui temporalem quærit gloriam, aut non ex animo contemnit, minus amare convincitur cælestem. Magnam habet cordis tranquillitatem, qui nec laudes curat, nec vituperia.	2. To glory in tribulation is not grievous to him who loveth; for such glorying is glorying in the Cross of Christ. Brief is the glory which is given and received of men. Sadness always goeth hand in hand with the glory of the world. The glory of the good is in their conscience, and not in the report of men. The joy of the upright is from God and in God, and their joy is in the truth. He who desireth true and eternal glory careth not for that which is temporal; and he who seeketh temporal glory, or who despiseth it from his heart, is proved to bear little love for that which is heavenly. He who careth for neither praises nor reproaches hath great tranquillity of heart.
3. Facile erit contentus et pacatus, cuius conscientia munda est. Non es sanctior, si laudaris, nec vilior, si vituperaris. Quod es hoc es, nec melior dici vales, quam Deo teste sis, si attendis quid apud te sis intus, non curabis quid de te loquantur homines foris. Homo videt in facie, Deus autem in corde. Homo confiderat actus, Deus pensat intentionem. Bene semper agere, et modicum de se tenere humilis animæ indicium est. Nolle consolari ab aliqua creatura magnæ puritatis, et internæ fiduciæ indicium est.	3. He will easily be contented and filled with peace, whose conscience is pure. Thou art none the holier if thou art praised, nor the viler if thou art reproached. Thou art what thou art; and thou canst not be better than God pronounceth thee to be. If thou considerest well what thou art inwardly, thou wilt not care what men will say to thee. Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart:man looketh on the deed, but God considereth the intent. It is the token of a humble spirit always to do well, and to set little by oneself. Not to look for consolation from any created thing is a sign of great purity and inward faithfulness.
4. Qui nullum extrinsecus pro se testimonium quærit, liquet quod Deo se totaliter commisit.Non enim, qui se ipsum commendat, ille probatus est,ait beatus Paulus,sed quem Deus commendat.Ambulare cum Deo intus, nec aliqua affectione teneri foris, status est interni hominis.	4. He that seeketh no outward witness on his own behalf, showeth plainly that he hath committed himself wholly to God. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, as St. Paul saith, but whom the Lord commendeth. To walk inwardly with God, and not to be held by any outer affections, is the state of a spiritual man.
Cap. 7. De amore Jesu super omnia.	CHAPTER VII Of loving Jesus above all things
1. Beatus qui intelligit quid sit amare Jesum, et contemnere se ipsum propeter Deum? Oportet dilectum propter dilectum relinquere, quia Jesus vult solus super omnia amari. Dilectio creaturæ fallax et instabilis, dilectio Jesu felix et perseverabilis. Qui adhæret creaturæ, cadet cum labili, qui amplectitur Jesum, firmabitur in Eum. Illum dilige, et amicum tene tibi, qui omnibus recedentibus te non relinquet, nec patietur in fine perire. Ab omnibus oportet aliquando te separari, sive velis, sive nolis.	1. Blessed is he who understandeth what it is to love Jesus, and to despise himself for Jesus’ sake. He must give up all that he loveth for his Beloved, for Jesus will be loved alone above all things. The love of created things is deceiving and unstable, but the love of Jesus is faithful and lasting. He who cleaveth to created things will fall with their slipperiness; but he who embraceth Jesus will stand upright for ever. Love Him and hold Him for thy friend, for He will not forsake thee when all depart from thee, nor will he suffer thee to perish at the last. Thou must one day be separated from all, whether thou wilt or wilt not.
2. Tene te apud Jesum vivens et moriens et illius fedelitati te committe, qui omnibus deficientibus solus potestte adjuvare. Dilectus tuus talis est naturæ, ut alienum non velit admittere, sed solus vult cor tuum habere, et tanquam rex in proprio throno sedere. Si scires te ab omni creatura evacuare, Jesus libenter tecum habitaret. Pene totum perditum invenies, quidquid extra Jesum in hominibus posueris. Non confidas, nec innitaris super calamum ventosum, quiaomnis caro fœnum, et omnis gloria ejus et flosfœni cadet.	2. Cleave thou to Jesus in life and death, and commit thyself unto His faithfulness, who, when all men fail thee, is alone able to help thee. Thy Beloved is such, by nature, that He will suffer no rival, but alone will possess thy heart, and as a king will sit upon His own throne. If thou wouldst learn to put away from thee every created thing, Jesus would freely take up His abode with thee. Thou wilt find all trust little better than lost which thou hast placed in men, and not in Jesus. Trust not nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind, because all flesh is grass, and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the field.
3. Cito deciperis, si ad externam hominum apparentiam tantum aspexeris. Si autem tuum in aliis quæris solatium, et lucrum, sæpe senties detrimentum. Si quæris in omnibus Jesum, invenies utique Jesum. Si autem quæris te ipsum, invenies etiam te ipsum, sed ad tuam perniciem. Plus enim homo nocivior est sibi, si Jesum non quærit, quam totus mundus, et omnes sui adversarii.	3. Thou wilt be quickly deceived if thou lookest only upon the outward appearance of men, for if thou seekest thy comfort and profit in others, thou shalt too often experience loss. If thou seekest Jesus in all things thou shalt verily find Jesus, but if thou seekest thyself thou shalt also find thyself, but to thine own hurt. For if a man seeketh not Jesus he is more hurtful to himself than all the world and all his adversaries.
Cap. 8. De familiari amicitia Jesu.	CHAPTER VIII Of the intimate love of Jesus
1. Quando Jesus adest, totum bonum est, nec quicquam difficile videtur. Quando vero Jesus non adest, totum durum est. Si autuem Jesus unum verbum loquitur tantum, magna consolatio sentitur. Nonne ne Maria Magdalena statim surreit de loco, in quo flevit, quando Martha illi dixit,Magister adet et vocat te?Felix hora quando Jesus vocat te de lacrymis ad gaudium spiritus. Quam aridus et durus es sine Jesu. Quam insipiens et vanus, si cupis aliquid extra Jesum. Nonne hoc est majus damnum, quam si totum perderes mundum?	1. When Jesus is present all is well and nothing seemeth hard, but when Jesus is not present everything is hard. When Jesus speaketh not within, our comfort is nothing worth, but if Jesus speaketh but a single word great is the comfort we experience. Did not Mary Magdalene rise up quickly from the place where she wept when Martha said to her, The Master is come and calleth for thee? Happy hour when Jesus calleth thee from tears to the joy of the spirit! How dry and hard art thou without Jesus! How senseless and vain if thou desirest aught beyond Jesus! Is not this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world?
2. Quid habet mundus conferre sine Jesu? Esse sine Jesu est gravis infernus, et esse cum Jesu dulcis paradisus. Si fuerit tecum Jesus, invenit thesaurum bonus, immo bonum super omne bonum. Et qui perdidit Jesum, perdidit nimis multum et plus quam totum mundum. Pauperrimus est qui vivit sine Jesu, ditissimus est qui bene est cum Jesu.	2. What can the world profit thee without Jesus? To be without Jesus is the nethermost hell, and to be with Jesus is sweet paradise. If Jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee. He who findeth Jesus findeth a good treasure, yea, good above all good; and he who loseth Jesus loseth exceeding much, yea, more than the whole world. Most poor is he who liveth without Jesus, and most rich is he who is much with Jesus.
3. Magna ars est scire conversari cum Jesu, et scire Jesum tenere, magna prudentia. Esto humilis et pacificus, et erit tecum Jesus. Sis devotus et quietus, et permanebit tecum Jesus. Potes cito fugare Jesum, et gratiam ejus perdere, si volueris ad exteriora declinare. Et si illum effugaveris et perdideris, ad quem tunc fugies, et quem tunc quæres amicum? Sine amico non potes diu vivere. Et si Jesus non fuerit tibi præ omnibus amicus, eris nimis tristis, et desolatus. Fatue igitur agis, si in aliquo altero confidis et lætaris. Eligendum est magis habere totum mundum contrarium, quam Jesum offensum. Ex omnibus ergo charis sit Jesus dilectus specialis.	3. It is great skill to know how to live with Jesus, and to know how to hold Jesus is great wisdom. Be thou humble and peaceable and Jesus shall be with thee. Be godly and quiet, and Jesus will remain with thee. Thou canst quickly drive away Jesus and lose His favour if thou wilt turn away to the outer things. And if thou hast put Him to flight and lost Him, to whom wilt thou flee, and whom then wilt thou seek for a friend? Without a friend thou canst not live long, and if Jesus be not thy friend above all thou shalt be very sad and desolate. Madly therefore doest thou if thou trusteth or findest joy in any other. It is preferable to have the whole world against thee, than Jesus offended with thee. Therefore of all that are dear to thee, let Jesus be specially loved.
4. Diligantur homines propter Jesum, Jesus autem propter se ipsum. Solus Jesus Christus singulariter est amandus, qui bonus solus et fidelis invenitur præ omnibus amicis. Propter ipsum et in ipso tam amici quam inimici tibi sint chari et pro omnibus his exorandus est, ut omnes ipsum cognoscant et diligant. Nunquam cupias singulariter laudari et amari, quia hoc solius Dei est, qui similem sibi non habet. Nec velis quod aliquis in corde tuo tecum occupetur, neque tu cum alicujus occuperis amore. Sed sit Jesus in te, et in omni bono homine.	4. Let all be loved for Jesus’ sake, but Jesus for His own. Jesus Christ alone is to be specially loved, for He alone is found good and faithful above all friends. For His sake and in Him let both enemies and friends be dear to thee, and pray for them all that they may all know and love Him. Never desire to be specially praised or loved, because this belongeth to God alone, who hath none like unto Himself. Nor wish thou that any one set his heart on thee, nor do thou give thyself up to the love of any, but let Jesus be in thee and in every good man.
5. Esto purus, et liber intus, sine alicujus creaturæ implicamento. Oportet te esse nudum, et purum cor ad Jesum gerere, si vis vacare, etvidere, quam suavis est Dominus.Et revera ad hoc non pervenies, nisi gratia ejus fueris præventus, et introtractus, ut omnibus evacuatis et licentiatis, solus cum Deo uniaris. Quando enim gratia Dei venit ad hominem, tunc potens sit ad omnia. Et quando recedit, tunc pauper et infirmus erit, et quasi tantum ad flagella relictus. In his non debes dejici, nec desperare, sed ad voluntatem Dei æquanimiter stare, et cuncta supervenientia tibi ad laudem Jesu Christi perpeti. Quia post hiemem sequitur aestas, post nectem redit dies, et post tempestatem serenitas magna.	5. Be pure and free within thyself, and be not entangled by any created thing. Thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to God, if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the Lord is. And in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by His grace, thou wilt not attain to this, that having cast out and dismissed all else, thou alone art united to God. For when the grace of God cometh to a man, then he becometh able to do all things, and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and given up unto troubles. In these thou art not to be cast down nor to despair, but to rest with calm mind on the will of God, and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of Jesus Christ; for after winter cometh summer, after night returneth day, after the tempest a great calm.
Cap. 9. De carentia omnis solatii.	CHAPTER IX Of the lack of all comfort
1. Non est grave humanum contemnere solatium, cum adest divinum. Magnum est, et valde magnum, tam humano quam divino posse carere solatio et pro amore Dei libenter exilium cordis velle sustinere et in nullo se ipsum quærere, nec ad proprium meritum respicere. Quid magis es, si hilaris si, et devotus adveniente gratia? Optabilis cunctis hæc hora. Satis suaviter equitat quem gratia Dei portat. Et quid mirum si onus non sentit, qui portatur ab Omnipotente, et ducitur a summo Ductore?	1. It is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is present. It is a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear the loss both of human and divine comfort; and for the love of God willingly to bear exile of heart, and in nought to seek oneself, nor to look to one’s own merit. What great matter is it, if thou be cheerful of heart and devout when favour cometh to thee? That is an hour wherein all rejoice. Pleasantly enough doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth. And what marvel, if he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty, and is led onwards by the Guide from on high?
2. Libenter aliquid habemus pro solatio, et homo difficulter exuitur a se ipso. Vicit sanctus Laurentius sæculum, cum Summo Sacerdote, quia omne, quod in mundo delectabile videbatur despexit, et Dei Summum Sacerdotem Sixtem, quem maxime diligebat, pro amore Christi etiam a se tolli clementer ferebat. Amore igitur Creatoris amorem hominis superavit, et pro humano solatio divinum beneplacitum magis elegit. Ita et tu aliquem necessarium, et dilectum amicum pro amore Dei disce relinquere. Nec graviter feras cum ab amico fueris derelictus, sciens quoniam oportet nos omnes tandem ab invicem separari.	2. We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is difficult for a man to be freed from himself. The holy martyr Laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly master, because he despised everything in the world which seemed to be pleasant; and for the love of Christ he calmly suffered even God’s chief priest, Sixtus, whom he dearly loved, to be taken from him. Thus by the love of the Creator he overcame the love of man, and instead of human comfort he chose rather God’s good pleasure. So also learn thou to resign any near and beloved friend for the love of God. Nor take it amiss when thou hast been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted from one another at last.
3. Multum et diu oportet hominem in se ipso certare, antequam discat se ipsum plene superare, et totum affectum suum plene in Deum trahere. Quando homo stat super se ipsum, facile labitur ad consolationes humanas. Sed verus Christi amator, et studiosus sectator virtutum non cadit super illas consolationes, nec quærit tales sensibiles dulcedines. Sed magis fortes tentationes et exercitationes, et pro Christo duros sustinere labores.	3. Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he learn altogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole affection towards God. When a man resteth upon himself, he easily slippeth away unto human comforts. But a true lover of Christ, and a diligent seeker after virtue, falleth not back upon those comforts, nor seeketh such sweetness as may be tasted and handled, but desireth rather hard exercises, and to undertake severe labours for Christ.
4. Cum igitur spiritualis consolatio a Deo datur, cum gratiarum actione accipe eam et Dei munus intellige esse, et non tuum meritum et noli extolli. Noli nimium gaudere nec inaniter præsumere, sed esto magis humilior ex dono, cautior quoque et timoratior in cunctis actibus tuis, quoniam transibit hora illa, et sequetur tentatio. Cum ablata fuerit consolatio, non statim desperes, sed cum humilitate, et patientia exspecta cælestem visitationem, quia potens est Deus ampliorem tibi redonare gratiam et consolationem. Istud non est novum, nec alienum viam Dei expertis, quia in magnis sanctis, et in antiquis prophetis suit sæpe alternationis modus.	4. When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it with giving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not thy desert. Be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly presume, but rather be more humble for the gift, more wary and more careful in all thy doings; for that hour will pass away, and temptation will follow. When comfort is taken from thee, do not straightway despair, but wait for the heavenly visitation with humility and patience, for God is able to give thee back greater favour and consolation. This is not new nor strange to those who have made trial of the way of God, for with the great saints and the ancient prophets there was often this manner of change.
5. Unde quidam præsente jam gratia dicebat:Ego dixi in abundantia mea non movebor in æternum.Absente autem gratia quid in se fuerit expertus, adjungit dicens:Avertisti faciem tuam a me, et factus sum conturbatus.Inter hæc tamen nequaquam desperat, sed instantius Dominum rogat, et dicit:Ad te, Domine, clamabo, et ad Deum meum deprocabor.Denique orationis suæ fructum reportat, et se exauditum testatur dicens:Audivit Dominus et misertus est mei, Dominus factus est adjutor meus.Sed in quo?Convertisti,inquit,planctum meum in gaudium mihi, et circumdedisti me lætitia.Et si sic actum est cum magnis Sanctis, non est desperandum nobis informis et pauperibus, si interdum in frigiditate, et interdum in fervore sumus. Quoniam spiritus venit, et recedit, secundum suæ voluntatis beneplacitum.  Unde beatus Job ait:Visitas eum iluculo, et subito probas illum.	5. Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with him, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved, but he goeth on to say what he felt within himself when the favour departed: Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled. In spite whereof he in no wise despaireth, but the more instantly entreateth God, and saith, Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and will pray unto my God; and then he receiveth the fruit of his prayer, and testifieth how he hath been heard, saying, The Lord heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my helper. But wherein? Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. If it was thus with the great saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to despair if we are sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the cold, for the Spirit cometh and goeth according to the good pleasure of His will. Wherefore holy Job saith, Thou dost visit him in the morning, and suddenly Thou dost prove him.
6. Super quid igitur sperare possum, aut in quo confidere debeo, nisi in sola magna misericordia Domini, et in sola spe gratiæ cælestis? Sive enim adsint homines boni sive devoti fratres, et amici fideles, sive libri sancti, vel tractatus pulchri, sive dulces cantus et hymni, omnia hæc modicum juvant, et modicum sapiunt, quando sum defertus a gratia, et in propria paupertate relictus. Tunc non est melius remedium quam patientia, et abnegatio mei in voluntate Dei.	6. Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only in the great mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace? For whether good men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends, whether holy books or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns and songs, all these help but little, and have but little savour when I am deserted by God’s favour and left to mine own poverty. There is no better remedy, then, than patience and denial of self, and an abiding in the will of God.
7. Nunquam inveni aliquem Religiosum, qui non habuerit interdum gratiæ subtractionem, aut non senserit fervoris diminutionem. Nullus Sanctus fuit tam alte raptus, vel illuminatus, qui prius vel postea non fuerit tentatus. Non enim alta Dei contemplatione dignus est, qui pro Deo non est exercitatus aliqua tribulatione. Solet enim sequentis consolationis tribulatio præcedens esse signum. Nam tentationibus probatis cælestis promittitur consolatio.Qui vicerit,inquit,dabo ei edere de ligno vitæ.	7. I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of fervour. No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so enlightened, but that sooner or later he was tempted. For he is not worthy of the great vision of God, who, for God’s sake, hath not been exercised by some temptation. For temptation is wont to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow, and heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by temptation. As it is written, To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life.
8. Datur etiam consolatio divina, ut homo fortior sit ad sustinendum adversa. Sequitur etiam tentatio, ne se elevet de bono. Non dormit diabolus, nec caro adhuc mortua est. Ideo non cesses te præparare ad certamen, quia a dextris et a sinistris sunt hostes qui nunquam quiescunt.	8. Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear adversities. And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up because of the benefit. The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not yet dead; therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto the battle, for enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left, and they are never at rest.
Cap. 10. De gratitudine progratia Dei.	CHAPTER X Of gratitude for the Grace of God
1. Quid quæris quietem, cum natus sis ad laborem, ad patientiam magis quam ad consolationem, et ad crucem portandam magis quam ad lætitiam? Quis etiam sæcularium non libenter consoltionem et lætitiam spiritualiem acciperet, si semper obtinere posset? Excedunt enim spirituales consolationes omnes mundi delicias et carnis voluptates. Nam omnes deliciæ mundanæ aut turpes, aut vanæ sunt. Spirituales vero deliciæ solæ sunt jucundæ et honestæ ex virtutibus progenitæ, et a Deo puris infusæ mentibus. Sed istis divnis consolationibus nemo semper pro suo affectu frui valet, quia tempus tentationis non diu cessat.	1. Why seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour? Prepare thyself for patience more than for comforts, and for bearing the cross more than for joy. For who among the men of this world would not gladly receive consolation and spiritual joy if he might always have it? For spiritual comforts exceed all the delights of the world, and all the pleasures of the flesh. For all worldly delights are either empty or unclean, whilst spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable, the offspring of virtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds. But no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own will, because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long.
2. Multum contrariatur supernæ visitationi salsa libertas animi, et magna confidentia sui. Deus benefacit consolatinis gratiam dando, sed homo male facit non statim Deo cum gratiarum actione retribuendo. Et ideo non possunt in nobis dona gratiæ fluere, quia ingrati sumus auctori, nec totum refundimus fontali origini. Semper enim debetur gratia digne gratias agenti sive referenti. Auferetur ab elato, quod dari solet humili.	2. Great is the difference between a visitation from above and false liberty of spirit and great confidence in self. God doeth well in giving us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not immediately giving God thanks thereof. And thus the gifts of grace are not able to flow unto us, because we are ungrateful to the Author of them, and return them not wholly to the Fountain whence they flow. For grace ever becometh the portion of him who is grateful and that is taken away from the proud, which is wont to be given to the humble.
3. Nolo consolationem quæ mihi auferat compunctionem, nec affecto contemplationem, quæ ducit in elationem. Non enim omne altum sanctum, nec omne desiderium purum, nec omne dulce bonum, nec omne carum gratum Deo. Libenter accepto gratiam unde humilior, et timoratior inveniar atque ad relinquendum me paratior fiam. Doctus dono gratiæ, et eruditus subtractionis verbere non sibi audebit, quidquam boni attribuere, sed potius se pauperem, et nudum confitebitur.Da Deo quidquid Dei est,et tibi adscribe, quod tuum est. Hoc est Deo gratias pro gratia tribue, tibi autem soli culpam, et dignam pœnam pro culpa deberi sentias.	3. I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction, I love no contemplation which leadeth to pride. For all that is high is not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every desire is not pure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing unto God. Willingly do I accept that grace whereby I am made humbler and more wary and more ready to renounce myself. He who is made learned by the gift of grace and taught wisdom by the stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not dare to claim any good thing for himself, but will rather confess that he is poor and needy. Give unto God the thing which is God’s, and ascribe to thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God for His grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy punishment is deserved for thy fault.
4. Pone te semper ad infimum, et dabitur tibi summum. Nam summum non stat sine infimo. Summi Sancti apud Deum minimi sunt apud se, et quanto gloriosiores, tanto in se humiliores; pleni veritate et gloria cælesti, non vanæ gloriæ cupidi et in Deo fundati et confirmati, nullo modo possunt esse elati. Et qui Deo totum adscribunt quidquid boni acceperunt, gloriam ab invicem non quærunt. Sedgloriam quæ a Deo estvolunt, et Deum quærunt in se, et in omnibus Sanctis laudari super omnia cupiunt, et semper in ipsum tendunt.	4. Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be given the highest place. For the highest cannot be without the lowest. For the highest saints of God are least in their own sight, and the more glorious they are, so much the lowlier are they in themselves; full of grace and heavenly glory, they are not desirous of vain-glory; resting on God and strong in His might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise. And they who ascribe unto God all the good which they have received, “seek not glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God only,” and they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all His Saints above all things, and they are always striving for this very thing.
5. Esto igitur gratus in minimo, et eris dignus majora accipere. Sit tibi minimum pro maximo et contemtibile pro speciali dono. Si dignitas datoris inspicitur, nullum datum parvum aut minus vile videbitur. Non enim parvum est quod a summo Deo donatur, etiam si pœnas et verbera donaverit, gratum esse debet, quia semper pro salute nostra facit quidquid nobis advenire permittit. Qui gratiam Dei retinere desiderat, sit gratus pro gratia Dei data, patiens pro sublata, oret ut reddatur, cautus sit et humilis ne amittat.	5. Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt be worthy to receive greater. Let the least be unto thee even as the greatest, and let that which is of little account be unto thee as a special gift. If the majesty of the Giver be considered, nothing that is given shall seem small and of no worth, for that is not a small thing which is given by the Most High God. Yea, though He gave punishment and stripes, we ought to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit whatever He suffereth to come upon us. He who seeketh to retain the favour of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and patient in respect of that which is taken away. Let him pray that it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it not.
Cap. 11. De paucitate amatorum crucis.	CHAPTER XI Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus
1. Habet autem Jesus multos amatores sui regnis cælestis, sed paucos bajulatores suæ crucis. Plures invenit socios mensæ sed paucos abstinentiæ. Omnes volunt cum Christo gaudere, sed pauci volunt aliquid pro ipso sustinere. Multi sequuntur Jesum usque as fractionem panis, sed pauci ad bibendum calicem passionis. Multi miracula ejus venerantur, sed pauci ignominias crucis sequuntur. Multi Jesum diligunt, quamdiu adversa non contingunt. Multi illum laudant et benedicunt, quamdiu consolationes aliquas ab ipso recipiunt. Si autem Jesus se abscondiderit, et modicum eos reliquerit, aut in querimoniam aut in dejectionem nimiam cadunt.	1. Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus Jesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of His Cross. He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of tribulation. He findeth many companions of His table, but few of His fasting. All desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to undergo anything for His sake. Many follow Jesus that they may eat of His loaves, but few that they may drink of the cup of His passion. Many are astonished at His Miracles, few follow after the shame of His Cross. Many love Jesus so long as no adversities happen to them. Many praise Him and bless Him, so long as they receive any comforts from Him. But if Jesus hide Himself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either into complaining or into too great dejection of mind.
2. Qui autem Jesum propter Jesum, et non propter aliquam suam consolationem propriam diligunt, ipsum in tribulatione, et in angustia cordis, sicut in summa consolatione diligunt, et benedicunt. Et si eis consolationem nunquam dare vellet, ipsum tamen laudarent, et semper gratias agere vellent.	2. But they who love Jesus for Jesus’ sake, and not for any consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and anguish of heart as in the highest consolation. And if He should never give them consolation, nevertheless they would always praise Him and always give Him thanks.
3. O, quantum potest amor Jesu purus, nullo propio commodo vel amore permixtus. Nonne omnes mercenarii sunt dicendi, qui consolationes semper quærunt? Nonne amatores sui magis quam Jesu probantur qui sua commoda vel lucra semper meditantur? Ubi invenitur talis, qui velit servire Deo gratis?	3. Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any gain or love of self! Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations? Do they not prove themselves lovers of self more than of Christ who are always seeking their own gain and advantage? Where shall be found one who is willing to serve God altogether for nought?
4. Raro invenitur tam spiritualis aliquis qui omnibus sit nudatus. Nam verum spiritu pauperem ab omni creatura nudum quis inveniet?Procul et de omnibus finibus pretium ejus.Si dederit homo omnem substantiam suam, adhuc nihil est. Et si fecerit pœnitentiam magnam, adhuc exiguum est. Et si apprehenderit omnem scientiam, adhuc longe est. Et si habuerit virtutem magnam, et devotionem nimis ardentem, adhuc sibi multum deest. Unum scilicet, quod sibi summe necessarium est. Quid illud? Ut omnibus relictis se relinquat, et a se totaliter exeat, nihilque de privato amore retineat. Cum omnia fecerit quæ facienda noverit, nihil se fecisse sentiat.	4. Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all selfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit and free of all created things? “His value is from afar, yea from the ends of the earth.” A man may give away all his goods, yet that is nothing; and if he do many deeds of penitence, yet that is a small thing; and though he understand all knowledge, yet that is afar off; and if he have great virtue and zealous devotion, yet much is lacking unto him, yea, one thing which is the most necessary to him of all. What is it then? That having given up all things besides, he give up himself and go forth from himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and having done all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he feel that he hath done nothing.
5. Non grande ponderet quod grandis extimari possit, sed in veritate fervum inutilem se pronunciet. Sicut veritas ait:Cum feceritis omnia quæ nobis præcepta sunt, adhuc dicite, quia servi inutiles sumus.Tunc vero pauper, et nudus spiritu esse poterit, et cum Propheta dicere:Quia unicus et pauper sum ego.Nemo isto ditior, nemo tam liberior, nemo potentior eo, qui scit se et omnia relinquere et ad infimum se ponere.	5. Let him not reckon that much which might be much esteemed, but let him pronounce himself to be in truth an unprofitable servant, as the Truth Himself saith, When ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants. Then may he be truly poor and naked in spirit, and be able to say with the Prophet, As for me, I am poor and needy. Nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man stronger, no man freer. For he knoweth both how to give up himself and all things, and how to be lowly in his own eyes.
Cap. 12. De regia via sanctae crucis.	CHAPTER XII Of the royal way of the Holy Cross
1. Durus hic multis videtur sermo.Abnego temet ipsum, tolle crucem tuam et sequere Jesum.Sed multo durius erit audire illud extremum verbum:Discedite a me, omnes maledicti, in ignem æternum.Qui enim modo libenter audiunt verbum crucis, et sequuntur, tunc non timebunt ab auditione æternæ damnationis. Hoc signum crucis erit in cælo, cum Dominus ad judicandum venerit. Tunc omnes servi crucis, qui se Crucifixo conformaverunt in vita, ad Christum accedent judicem cum magna fiducia.	1. That seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me. But it will be much harder to hear that last sentence, Depart from me, ye wicked, into eternal fire. For they who now willingly hear the word of the Cross and follow it, shall not then fear the hearing of eternal damnation. This sign of the Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord cometh to Judgment. Then all servants of the Cross, who in life have conformed themselves to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the Judge with great boldness.
2. Quid igitur times tollere crucem, per quam itur ad Regnum? In cruce salus. In cruce vita. In cruce protectio ab hostibus. In cruce robur mentis. In cruce gaudium spiritus. In cruce virtus summa. In cruce perfectio sanctitatis. Non est salus animae, nec spes æternæ vitæ, nisi in cruce. Tolle ergo crucem et sequere Jesum, et ibis in vitam æternam. Præcessit ille bajulans sibi crucem, et mortuus est pro te in cruce, ut tu etiam portes crucem, et mori affectes in cruce. Quia, si commortuus fueris in cruce, etiam cum illo pariter vives, et si socius fueris pœ, socius eris et gloriæ.	2. Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a kingdom? In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the Cross is protection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly sweetness, in the Cross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of the spirit, in the Cross the height of virtue, in the Cross perfection of holiness. There is no health of the soul, no hope of eternal life, save in the Cross. Take up therefore, thy cross and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal life. He went before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the Cross, that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be crucified upon it. For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also live with Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou shalt be also of His glory.
3. Ecce in cruce totum jacet, et non est alia via ad vitam, et ad veram et internam pacem, nisi via sanctæ crucis, et quotidianæ mortificationis. Ambula ubi vis, quære quodcumque volueris, et non invenies altiorem viam supra, nec securiorem infra, nisi viam sanctæ crucis. Dispone et ordina omnia secundum velle tuum et videre,et non invenies, nisi semper aliquid pati debere aut sponte aut invite et ita crucem semper invenies. Aut enim in corpore dolorem senties, aut in anima spiritus tribulationem sustinebis.	3. Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything lieth in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true inward peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily mortification. Go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt, and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below, than the way of the Holy Cross. Dispose and order all things according to thine own will and judgment, and thou shalt ever find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly, and thus thou shalt ever find thy cross. For thou shalt either feel pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.
4. Interdum a Deo relinqueris, interdum a proximo exercitaberis, et quod amplius est sæpe tibimetipsi gravis eris. Nec tamen aliquo remedio vel solatio liberari seu alleviari poteris, sed donec Deus voluerit, oportet ut sustineas. Vult enim Deus ut tribulationem sine consolatione discas pati, et illi totaliter te subjicias et humilior ex tribulatione fias. Nemo ita cordialiter sentit passionem Christi, sicut is cui contigerit similia pati. Crux igitur semper parata est, et ubique te exspectat. Non potes effugere ubicumque cucurreris, quia ubicumque veneris, temetipsum tecum portas, et semper te ipsum invenies. Converte te supra, converte te infra, converte te extra et intra, et in his omnibus invenies crucem, et necese est te ubicumque tenere patientiam, si internam vis habere pacem et perpetuam promereri coronam.	4. Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be tried by thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be wearisome to thyself. And still thou canst not be delivered nor eased by any remedy or consolation, but must bear so long as God will. For God will have thee learn to suffer tribulation without consolation, and to submit thyself fully to it, and by tribulation be made more humble. No man understandeth the Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath had somewhat of the like suffering himself. The Cross therefore is always ready, and every where waiteth for thee. Thou canst not flee from it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou comest, thou bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find thyself. Turn thee above, turn thee below, turn thee without, turn thee within, and in them all thou shalt find the Cross; and needful is it that thou everywhere possess patience if thou wilt have internal peace and gain the everlasting crown.
5. Si libenter crucem portas, portabit te, et deducet te ad desideratum finem, ubi scilicet finis patiendi erit. Si invite portas, onus tibi facis, et te ipsum magis gravas, et tamen oportet ut sustineas. Si abjicis unam crucem, aliam proculdubio invenies, et forsitan graviorem.	5. If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will bring thee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall be the end of suffering; though it shall not be here. If thou bear it unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly increaseth thy load, and yet thou must bear it. If thou cast away one cross, without doubt thou shalt find another and perchance a heavier.
6. Credis tu evadere, quod nemo mortalium potuit præterire? Quis Sanctorum in mundo sine cruce et tribulatione fuit? Nec enim Dominus noster Jesus Christus una hora sine dolore passionis fuit, quamdiu vixit.OpertebatautemChristum pati, et resurgere a mortuis, et ita intrare in gloriam suam.Et quomodo tu aliam viam crucem quæris, quam hanc regiam, quæ est via sanctæ crucis.	6. Thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to avoid? Which of the saints in the world hath been without the cross and tribulation? For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was one hour without the anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived. It behooved, He said, Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and so enter into his glory.  And how dost thou seek another way than this royal way, which is the way of the Holy Cross?
7. Tota vita Christi crux fuit, et martyrium, et tu tibi quæris reqiuem, et gaudium? Erras, erras si aliud quæris quam pati tribulationes, quia tota ista vita mortalis plena est miseriis, et circumsignata crucibus. Et quanto quis altius in spiritu profecerit, tanto gravioes cruces sæpe inveniet, quia exilii sui pœna magis ex amore crescit.	7. The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost thou seek for thyself rest and joy? Thou art wrong, thou art wrong, if thou seekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this whole mortal life is full of miseries, and set round with crosses. And the higher a man hath advanced in the spirit, the heavier crosses he will often find, because the sorrow of his banishment increaseth with the strength of his love.
8. Sed tamen iste sic multipliciter afflictus, non est sine lavamine consolationis, quia fructum magnum sibi sentit accrescere ex sufferentia suæ crucis. Nondum sponte illi se subjicit, omne onus tribulationis in fiduciam divinæ consolationis convertitur. Et quanto caro magis per tribulationem atteritur, tanto amplius spiritus per internam consolationem roboratur. Et nonnunquam in tantum confortatur ex affectu tribulationis, et adversitatis ob amorem conformitatis crucis Christi, ut non sine dolore, et tribulatione esse vellet, quoniam se tantum acceptiorem Deo reddit, quanto dura, et graviora plura pro eo ferre poterit. Non est istud virtus hominis, sed gratia Christi, quæ tanta potest, et agit in carne fragili, ut quod naturaliter semper abhorret et fugit, hoc fervore spiritus aggrediatur et diligat.	8. But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not without refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant fruit to be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross. For whilst he willingly submitteth himself to it, every burden of tribulation is turned into an assurance of divine comfort, and the more the flesh is wasted by affliction, the more is the spirit strengthened mightily by inward grace. And ofttimes so greatly is he comforted by the desire for tribulation and adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of Christ, that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more and the heavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake. This is not the virtue of man, but the grace of Christ which hath such power and energy in the weak flesh, that what it naturally hateth and fleeth from, this it draweth to and loveth through fervour of spirit.
9. Non est secundum hominem crucem portare, crucem amare, corpus castigare, et servituti subjicere, honores fugere, contumelias libenter sustinere, se ipsum despicere, et despici optare, adversa quæquæ cum damnis perpeti, et nihil prosperitatis in hoc mundo desiderare. Si ad te ipsum respicis, nihil hujusmodi ex te poteris. Sed si in Domino confidis, dabitur tibi fortitudo de cælo, et subjicientur ditioni tuæ mundus et caro, sed nec inimicum diabolum timebis, si fueris fide armatus, et cruce Jesu signatus.	9. It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the cross, to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to fly from honours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and desire to be despised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to desire no prosperity in this world. If thou lookest to thyself, thou wilt of thyself be able to do none of this; but if thou trustest in the Lord, endurance shall be given thee from heaven, and the world and the flesh shall be made subject to thy command. Yea, thou shalt not even fear thine adversary the devil, if thou be armed with faith and signed with the Cross of Christ.
10. Pone ergo te sicut fidelis et bonus servus Christi ad portandum viriliter crucem Domini tui pro te ex amore crucifixi. Præpara te ad toleranda multa adversa, et varia incommoda in hac misera vita, quia sic tecum erit ubicumque, et sic revera eum invenies ubicumque latueris. Oportet te ita esse, et non est remedium evadendi a tribulatione malorum, et dolore, quam ut te patiaris. Calicem Domini affectanter bibe, si amicus ejus esse, et partem cum eo habere desideras. Consolationes Deo committe, faciat ipse cum talibus sicut sibi magis placuerit. Tu vero pone te ad sustinendum tribulatones, et reputa eas maximas consolationes, quianon sunt condignæ passiones hujus temporis ad futuram gloriam, quæ revelabitur in nobis,promerendam, etiam si omnes solus posses sustinere.	10. Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of Christ, to the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out of love was crucified for thee. Prepare thyself for the bearing many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life; because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art, and so in very deed thou shalt find it, wherever thou hide thyself. This it must be; and there is no means of escaping from tribulation and sorrow, except to bear them patiently. Drink thou lovingly thy Lord’s cup if thou desirest to be His friend and to have thy lot with Him. Leave consolations to God, let Him do as seemeth best to Him concerning them. But do thou set thyself to endure tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us, nor would they be even if thou wert to endure them all.
11. Quando ad hoc veneris, quod tribulatio tibi dulcis erit et sapiet pro Christo, tunc bene tecum esse exstima, quia invenisti paradisum in terra. Quamdiu tibi pati grave est et fugere quæris, tamdiu male habebis, et sequentur te ubique tribulationes.	11. When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and pleasant to thee for Christ’s sake, then reckon that it is well with thee, because thou hast found paradise on earth. So long as it is hard to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long it will not be well with thee, and tribulations will follow thee everywhere.
12. Si ponis te ad quod esse debes, videlicet ad patiendum, et moriendum, fiet cito melius, et pacem invenies. Etiamsi raptus fueris in tertium cælum cum Paulo, non es propterea securus de  nullo malo sustinendo.Ego,inquit Jesus,ostendam illi quanta oporteat eum pro nomine meo pati.Pati ergo tibi remanet, si Deum diligere, et perpetue illi servire placeat.	12. If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to suffer and to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou shalt find peace. Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul unto the third heaven, thou art not on that account secure from suffering evil. I will show him, saith Jesus, what great things he must suffer for My Name’s sake. It remaineth, therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou wilt love Jesus and serve Him continually.
13. Utinam dignus esses, pro nomine Jesu aliqud pati, quam magna gloria remaneret tibi, quanta exultatio omnibus Sanctis Dei, quanta ædificatio esset proximi. Nam patientiam omnes commendant, quamvis pauci pati velint. Merito deberes modicum pati pro Christo, cum multi graviora patiantur pro mundo.	13. Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among all the saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour! For all men commend patience, although few be willing to practise it. Thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for Christ when many suffer heavier things for the world.
14. Scias pro certo, quia morientem te oportet ducere vitam. Et quanto unusquisque plus sibi moritur, tanto Deo magis vivere incipit. Nemo aptus est ad comprehendendum cælestia, nisi se submiserit ad portandum pro Christo adversa. Nihil Deo acceptius, nihil tibi salubrius in mundo isto, quam libenter pati pro Christo. Et si eligendum tibi esset, magis optare deberes pro Christo adversa pati, quam multis consolationibus recreari, quia Christo similior esses, et omnibus Sanctis conformior. Non enim stat meritum nostrum et profectus status nostri in multis sensualitatibus, et consolationibus, sed potius in magnis gravitatibus et tribulationibus perferendis.	14. Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of a dying man. And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he beginneth to live towards God. None is fit for the understanding of heavenly things, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing adversities for Christ. Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing more healthful for thyself in this world, than to suffer willingly for Christ. And if it were thine to choose, thou oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for Christ, than to be refreshed with manifold consolations, for thou wouldest be more like Christ and more conformed to all saints. For our worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and consolations, but rather in bearing many troubles and adversities.
15. Si quidem aliquid melius et utilius saluti hominum quam pati fuisset, Christus utique verbo et exemplo ostendisset. Nam et se sequentes discipulos omnesque eum sequi cupientes, manifeste ad crucem portandam hortatur, et dicit:Si quis vult venire post me, abneget semetipsum, et tollat crucem suam, et sequatur me.Omnibus ergo perlectis et scrutatis sit ista finalis conclusio:quoniam per multas tribulationes oportet nos intrare in regnum Dei.Amen.	15. If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable to the health of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have shown it by word and example. For both the disciples who followed Him, and all who desire to follow Him, He plainly exhorteth to bear their cross, and saith, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow Me. So now that we have thoroughly read and studied all things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Amen.
