1	1	I.1	1	Liber Primus: Admonitiones ad Vitam spiritualem utiles.	THE FIRST BOOK: ADMONITIONS PROFITABLE FOR THE SPIRITUAL LIFE
2	1	I.2	2	I. De imitatione Christi et contemptu mundi omniumque eius vanitatum.	I Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities
3	1	I.3	3	Qui sequitur me non ambulat in tenebrisdicit Dominus. Hæc sunt verba Christi, quibus admonemur quatenus vitam eius et mores imitemur, si volumus veraciter illuminari, et ab omni cæcitate cordis liberari. Summum igitur studium nostrum, sit in vita Jesu meditari.	He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, saith the Lord. These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.
4	1	I.4	4	Doctrina Ejus omnes doctrinas Sanctorum præcellit, et qui spiritum haberetabsconditum ibi mannainveniret. Sed contingit quod multi ex frequenti auditu Evangelii parvum desiderium sentiunt, quia spiritum Chrisi non habent. Qui autem vult plene et sapide verba Christi intelligere, oportet ut totam vitam suam illi studeat conformare.	His teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men, and such as have His Spirit find therein the hidden manna. But there are many who, though they frequently hear the Gospel, yet feel but little longing after it, because they have not the mind of Christ. He, therefore, that will fully and with true wisdom understand the words of Christ, let him strive to conform his whole life to that mind of Christ.
5	1	I.5	5	Quid prodest tibi alta de Trinitate disputare, si careas humilitate unde displiceas Trinitati? Vere alta verba non faciunt sanctum et justum, sed virtuosa vita efficit Deo carum. Opto magis sentire compunctionem quam scire definitionem. Si scires totam Bibliam, et omnium philosophorum dicta quid totum prodesset, sine charitate et gratia?Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitaspræter amare Deum et illi soli fervire. Ista est summa sapientia per contemptum mundi tendere ad regna cælestia.	What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion concerning the Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus displeasing to the Trinity? For verily it is not deep words that make a man holy and upright; it is a good life which maketh a man dear to God. I had rather feel contrition than be skilful in the definition thereof. If thou knewest the whole Bible, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit thee without the love and grace of God? Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, save to love God, and Him only to serve. That is the highest wisdom, to cast the world behind us, and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom.
6	1	I.6	6	Vanitas igitur est divitias perituras quærere, et in illis sperare. Vanitas quoque est honores ambire, et in altum se extollere. Vanitas est carnis desideria sequi, et illud desiderare unde postmodum graviter oportet puniri. Vanitas est longam vitam optare, et de bona vita modicum curare. Vanitas est præsentem vitam solum attendere, et quæ futura sunt non prævidere. Vanitas est diligere quod cum omni celeritate transit, et illuc non festinare ubi sempiternum manet gaudium.	It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that shall perish. It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to lift up ourselves on high. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last. It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life. It is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter. It is vanity to love that which quickly passeth away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abideth.
7	1	I.7	7	Stude ergo cor tuum ab amore visibilium abstrahere, et ad invisiblia te transferre. Nam sequentes suam sensualitatem maculant conscientiam, et perdunt Dei gratiam.	Be ofttimes mindful of the saying, The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing. Strive, therefore, to turn away thy heart from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen. For they who follow after their own fleshly lusts, defile the conscience, and destroy the grace of God.
8	1	I.8	8	De humili scire sui ipsius.	II Of thinking humbly of oneself
9	1	I.9	9	Omnis homo naturaliter scire desiderat. Sed scientia sine timore Dei quid importat? Melior est profecto Rusticus humilis, qui Deo fervit, quam superbus Philosophus, qui se neglecto cursum cæli confiderat. Qui bene se ipsum cognoscit sibi ipsi vilescit, nec laudibus delectatur humanis. Si scirem omnia quæ in mundo sunt, et non essem in charitate, quid me juvaret coram Deo, qui me judicaturus est ex facto?	There is naturally in every man a desire to know, but what profiteth knowledge without the fear of God? Better of a surety is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself. He who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither regardeth he the praises of men. If I knew all the things that are in the world, and were not in charity, what should it help me before God, who is to judge me according to my deeds?
10	1	I.10	10	Quiesce a nimio discendi desiderio, quia ibi magna incitatur distractio et deceptio. Scientes volunt libenter docti videri et sapientes dici. Multa sunt quæ scire animæ parum vel nihil prodest. Et valde insipiens est, qui aliquibus magis intendit, quam his quæ saluti suæ deserviunt. Multa verba non satiant animam, sed bona vita refrigerat mentem, et pura conscientia magnam ad Deum præstat confidentiam.	Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for therein is found much distraction and deceit. Those who have knowledge desire to appear learned, and to be called wise. Many things there are to know which profiteth little or nothing to the soul. And foolish out of measure is he who attendeth upon other things rather than those which serve to his soul’s health. Many words satisfy not the soul, but a good life refresheth the mind, and a pure conscience giveth great confidence towards God.
11	1	I.11	11	Quanto plus et melius scis, tanto gravius judicaberis inde nisi sancte vixeris. Noli ergo extolli de ulla arte vel scientia, sed potius time de data tibi notitia. Si tibi videtur quod multa scias et satis bene intelligas, scito tamen quia sunt multo plura quæ nesci.Noli sapere altum,sed ignorantiam tuam magis fatere. Quid te vis alicui præferre, cum plures doctiores te inveniantur, et magis in lege periti. Si vis aliquid utiliter scire, et discere, ama nesciri, et pro nihilo reputari.	The greater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely shalt thou be judged, unless thou hast lived holily. Therefore be not lifted up by any skill or knowledge that thou hast; but rather fear concerning the knowledge which is given to thee. If it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things, and understandest them well, know also that there are many more things which thou knowest not. Be not high-minded, but rather confess thine ignorance. Why desirest thou to lift thyself above another, when there are found many more learned and more skilled in the Scripture than thou? If thou wilt know and learn anything with profit, love to be thyself unknown and to be counted for nothing.
12	1	I.12	12	Hæc est altissima et utilissima lectio, sui ipius vera cognitio, et despectio. De se ipso nihil tenere, et de aliis semper bene et alte sentire magna sapientia est, et perfectio. Si videres aliquem aperte peccare, vel aliqua gravia perpetrare, non deberes te meliorem exstimare, quia nescis quamdiu possis in bono stare. Omnes fragiles sumus, sed tu neminem fragiliorem te ipso tenebis.	That is the highest and most profitable lesson, when a man truly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself. To account nothing of one’s self, and to think always kindly and highly of others, this is great and perfect wisdom. Even shouldest thou see thy neighbor sin openly or grievously, yet thou oughtest not to reckon thyself better than he, for thou knowest not how long thou shalt keep thine integrity. All of us are weak and frail; hold thou no man more frail than thyself.
13	1	I.13	13	De doctrina veritatis.	III Of the knowledge of truth
14	1	I.14	14	Felix quem Veritas per se ipsam docet, non per figuras et voces transeuntes, sed sicuti se habet. Nostra opinion, et noster sensus sæpe nos fallit, et modicum videt. Quid prodest magna cavillatio de occultis, et obscuris rebus de quibus nec argueur in judicio, quia ignoravimus? Grandis insipientia quod neglectis utilibus, et necessariis, ultro intendimus curiosis, et damnosis. Oculos habentes, non videmus.	Happy is the man whom Truth by itself doth teach, not by figures and transient words, but as it is in itself. Our own judgment and feelings often deceive us, and we discern but little of the truth. What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not? Oh, grievous folly, to neglect the things which are profitable and necessary, and to give our minds to things which are curious and hurtful! Having eyes, we see not.
15	1	I.15	15	Et quid nobis de generibus et speciebus, cui æternum Verbum loquitur a multis opinionibus expeditur. Ex uno Verbo omnia, et unum loquuntur omnia et hoc estPrincipium quod et loquitur nobis.Nemo sine illo intelligit, aut recte judicat. Cuit omnia unam sunt, et qui omnia ad unum trahit, et omnia in uno videt, potest stabilis esse, et in Deo pacificus permanere. O veritas Deus, fac me unum tecum in charitate perpetua. Tædet mihi sæpe multa legere, t audire: in te toum est, quod volo et desidero. Taceant omnes doctores, sileant universæ creaturæ in conspectu tuo, tu mihi loquere solus.	And what have we to do with talk about genus and species! He to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from multiplied questionings. From this One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him; and this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto us. No man without Him understandeth or rightly judgeth. The man to whom all things are one, who bringeth all things to one, who seeth all things in one, he is able to remain steadfast of spirit, and at rest in God. O God, who art the Truth, make me one with Thee in everlasting love. It wearieth me oftentimes to read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish for and desire. Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all creation keep silence before Thee: speak Thou alone to me.
16	1	I.16	16	Quanto magis aliquis unitus, et interius implicatus fuerit, tanto plura et altiora sine labore intelligit quia desuper lumen intelligentiæ accipit. Purus simplex et stabilis in multis operibus non dissipatur, quia omnia ad Dei honorem operatur, et in se otiose ab omni propria exquisitione esse nititur. Quis te magis impedit, et molestat quam tua immortificata cordis affectio? Bonus et devotus homo, opera sua intus prius disponit, quæ foris agere debet, nec illa trahunt ad desideria vitiosæ inclinationis, sed ipse inflectat ea ad arbitrium rectæ intentionis rationis. Quis habet fortius certamen, quam qui nititur vincere se ipsum? Et hoc deberet esse negotium nostrum, vincere scilicet se ipsum, et quotidie se fortiorem ipso fieri, atque in melius proficere.	The more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself, the more things and the deeper things he understandeth; and that without labour, because he receiveth the light of understanding from above. The spirit which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not distracted though it hath many works to do, because it doth all things to the honour of God, and striveth to be free from all thoughts of self-seeking. Who is so full of hindrance and annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart? A man who is good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart the works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the desires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the judgment of right reason. Who hath a harder battle to fight than he who striveth for self-mastery? And this should be our endeavour, even to master self, and thus daily to grow stronger than self, and go on unto perfection.
17	1	I.17	17	Omnis perfectio in hac vita quamdam imperfectionem sibi habet annexam. Et omnis speculatio nostra quadam caligine non caret. Humilis tui cognitio certior via est ad Deum, quam profundæ scientiæ inquisitio. Non est culpanda scientia, aut quælibet rei notitia quæ bona est, in se confiderata, eet a Deo ordinata, sed præferenda est, semper bona conscientia, et vita, quia student magis plures scire quam bene vivere, ideo sæpe errant, et nullum vel modicum fructum ferunt.	All perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness. A lowly knowledge of thyself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man’s learning. Not that learning is to be blamed, nor the taking account of anything that is good; but a good conscience and a holy life is better than all. And because many seek knowledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray, and bear little or no fruit.
18	1	I.18	18	O, si tantam adhiberent diligentiam ad extirpanda vitia, et virtutes inferendas, sicuti movendi quæstiones, non fierent tanta mala et scandala in populo nec tanta dissolutio in cænobiis. Certe adveniente e judicii, non quæretur a nobis quid legimus, sed quid fecimus; nec quam bene diximus, sed quam religiose visimus. Dic mihi, ubi sunt modo illi omnes Domini, et Magistri quos bene nosti dum adhuc bene viverent, et in studiis florerent? Jam eorum præbendas alii possident, et nescio utrum de eis recogitent. In vita sua aliquid videbantur et modo de illis tacetur.	O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain questionings: there had not been so many evil doings and stumbling-blocks among the laity, nor such ill living among houses of religion. Of a surety, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have done; not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived. Tell me, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou knewest well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished in learning? Their stalls are now filled by others, who perhaps never have one thought concerning them. Whilst they lived they seemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them.
19	1	I.19	19	O quam cito transit gloria mundi. Utinam vita eorum scientiæ concordasset eorum, tunc bene legissent et studuissent. Quam multi pereunt per vanam scientiam in hoc sæculo, qui parum curant de Dei fervitio. Et quia magis diligunt magni esse quam humiles, ideo evanuerunt in cognitationibus suis. Vere magnus est qui in si parvus est et pro nihilo omne culmen honoris ducit. Vere prudens est qui omnia terrenaarbitratur uti stercora ut Christum lucrifaciat.Et vere bene doctus est qui Dei voluntatem facit et suam voluntatem relinquit.	Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away! Would that their life and knowledge had agreed together! For then would they have read and inquired unto good purpose. How many perish through empty learning in this world, who care little for serving God. And because they love to be great more than to be humble, therefore they “have become vain in their imaginations.” He only is truly great, who hath great charity. He is truly great who deemeth himself small, and counteth all height of honour as nothing. He is the truly wise man, who counteth all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ. And he is the truly learned man, who doeth the will of God, and forsaketh his own will.
20	1	I.20	20	De prudentia in agendis.	IV Of prudence in action
21	1	I.21	21	Non est credendum omni verbo nec instinctui sed caute et longanimiter, res est fecundum Deum ponderanda. Proh dolor sæpe malum facilius quam bonum de alio creditur et dicitur ita infirmi sumus. Sed perfecti viri non facile credunt omni enarrant, quia sciunt humanam fragilitatem imo infirmitatem ad malum proclivem et in verbis fatis labilem.	We must not trust every word of others or feeling within ourselves, but cautiously and patiently try the matter, whether it be of God. Unhappily we are so weak that we find it easier to believe and speak evil of others, rather than good. But they that are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer, for they know man’s weakness that it is prone to evil and unstable in words.
22	1	I.22	22	Magna sapientia est non esse præcipitem in agendis, nec pertinaciter in sensibus stare. Ad hanc etiam non pertinet quibuslibet hominum verbis credere nec audita vel credita mox ad aliorum aures effundere.	This is great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubborn in our own opinions. A part of this wisdom also is not to believe every word we hear, nor to tell others all that we hear, even though we believe it.
23	1	I.23	23	Cum sapiente et sententioso viro consilium habe, et quære potius a melioribus instrui, quam tuas adinventiones sequi. Bona vita facit hominem sapientem secundum Deum, et expertum in multis. Quanto quis in se humilior fuerit, et Deo subjectior, tanto in omnibus erit sapientior et pacatior.	Take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by one better than thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions. A good life maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience in many things. The more humble a man is in himself, and the more obedient towards God, the wiser will he be in all things, and the more shall his soul be at peace.
24	1	I.24	24	De lectione scripturarum.	V Of the reading of Holy Scriptures
25	1	I.25	25	Veritas est in Scripturis sanctis quærenda, non eloquenda. Omnis Scriptura sacra eo spiritu debet legi, quo facta est. Quærere debemus potius utilitatem in Scripturis, quam subtilitatem sermonis. Ita libenter devotos et simplices libros legere debemus, sicut altos et profundos. Non te defendat auctoritas Scribentis utrum parvæ vel magnæ litteraturæ fuerit, sed amor puræ veritatis te trahat ad legendum. Non quæras quis hoc dixerit, sed quid dicatur attende.	It is Truth which we must look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of words. All Scripture ought to be read in the spirit in which it was written. We must rather seek for what is profitable in Scripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse. Therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple, as well as those which are deep and difficult. And let not the weight of the writer be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be of little or much learning, but let the love of the pure Truth draw thee to read. Ask not, who hath said this or that, but look to what he says.
26	1	I.26	26	Homines transeunt, sedveritas Domini manet in æternum.Sine personarum acceptione variis modis nobis loquitur Deus. Curiositas nostra sæpe nos impedit in lectione Scripturarum, cum volumus intelligere et discutere ubi simpliciter est transeundum. Si vis profectum haurire lege humiliter, simpliciter, et fideliter nec unquam velis habere nomen scientiæ. Interroga libenter, et audi tacens Sanctorum verba, nec displiceant tibi parabolæ Seniorum sine cause enim non proferuntur.	Men pass away, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Without respect of persons God speaketh to us in divers manners. Our own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading of holy writings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should pass simply on. If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read humbly, simply, honestly, and not desiring to win a character for learning. Ask freely, and hear in silence the words of holy men; nor be displeased at the hard sayings of older men than thou, for they are not uttered without cause.
27	1	I.27	27	De inordinatis affectibus.	VI Of inordinate affections
28	1	I.28	28	Quandocumque homo inordinate aliquid appetit statim in se inquietus sit. Superbus et avarus nunquam quiescunt. Pauper et humilis spiritu in multitudine pacis conversatur. Homo qui necdum in se perfecte mortuus est, cito tentatur et vincitur in parvis et vilibus rebus. Infirmus in spiritu, et quodammodo adhuc carnalis ad sensibilia inclinatus, difficulter potest se a terrenis desideriis ex toto extrahere. Et ideo sæpe habet tristitiam cum se subtrahit. Leviter etiam dedignatur, si quis ei resistit.	Whensoever a man desireth aught above measure, immediately he becometh restless. The proud and the avaricious man are never at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the multitude of peace. The man who is not yet wholly dead to self, is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters. It is hard for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part carnal and inclined to the pleasures of sense, to withdraw himself altogether from earthly desires. And therefore, when he withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily angered too if any oppose his will.
29	1	I.29	29	Si autem profecutus fuerit quod concupiscitur, statim ex reatu conscientiæ gravatur, quia secutus est passionem suam, quæ nihil juvat ad pacem, quam quæsivit. Resistendo igitur passionibus invenitur vera pax cordis non autem serviendo eis. Non est ergo pax in corde hominis carnalis, non in homine in exterioribus dedito, sed in fervido spirituali.	But if, on the other hand, he yield to his inclination, immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his conscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in no way attained the peace which he hoped for. For true peace of heart is to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it. And therefore there is no peace in the heart of a man who is carnal, nor in him who is given up to the things that are without him, but only in him who is fervent towards God and living the life of the Spirit.
30	1	I.30	30	De vana spe et elatione fugienda.	VII Of fleeing from vain hope and pride
31	1	I.31	31	Vanus est qui spem suam ponit in hominibus aut in creaturis. Non pudeat te aliis servire amore Domini nostri Jesu Christi, et pauperem in hoc sæculo videri. Non stes super teipsum, sed in Deo spem tuam constitue. Fac quod in te est, et Deus aderit bonæ voluntati tuæ. Non confidas in tua scientia, vel cujuscumque astutia viventi, sed magis in Dei gratia, qui humiles adjuvat, et de se præsumentes humiliat.	Vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in any created Thing. Be not ashamed to be the servant of others for the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this life. Rest not upon thyself, but build thy hope in God. Do what lieth in thy power, and God will help thy good intent. Trust not in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that lives, but rather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.
32	1	I.32	32	Non glorieris in divitiis si adsint, nec in amicis quia potentes sunt, sed in Deo qui omnia præstat, et se ipsum super omnia dare desiderat. Non te extollas de magnitudine vel pulchritudine corporis, quæ modica etiam infirmitate corrumpitur et foedatur. Non placeas tibi ipsi, de humilitate aut ingenio ne displiceas Deo, cujus est totum quidquid boni naturaliter habemus.	Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast them, nor in thy friends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all things, and in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself. Be not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away. Be not vain of thy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from whom cometh every good gift which we have.
33	1	I.33	33	Non te reputes aliis meliorem, ne forte coram Deo deterior habearis qui scit quid est in homine. Non superbias de operibus bonis, quia aliter sunt judicia Dei quam hominum, cui sæpe displicet, quod hominibus placet. Si aliquid boni habueris, crede de aliis meliora, ut humilitatem conserves. Non nocet ut te hominibus supponas, nocet autem plurimum, si vel uni te præponas. Jugis pax cum humili, in corde autem superbi zelus et indignatio frequens.	Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou appear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man. Be not proud of thy good works, for God’s judgments are of another sort than the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes displeasing to Him. If thou hast any good, believe that others have more, and so thou mayest preserve thy humility. It is no harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but it is great harm if thou place thyself above even one. Peace is ever with the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is envy and continual wrath.
34	1	I.34	34	De cavenda nimia familiaritate.	VIII Of the danger of too much familiarity
35	1	I.35	35	Nonomni homini reveles cor tuum,sed cum sapiente, et timente Deum age causam tuam? Cum juvenibus et extraneis rarus esto, cum divitibus noli blandiri, et coram magnatis non libenter appareas. Cum humilibus et simplicibus, cum devotis et morigeratis sociare, et quæ ædificationis sunt pertracta. Non sis familiaris alicui mulieri, sed in communi omnes bonas mulieres Deo commenda. Soli Deo et Angelis ejus opta familiaris esse, et hominum notitiam devita.	Open not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise and feareth God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers. Be not a flatterer of the rich; nor willingly seek the society of the great. Let thy company be the humble and the simple, the devout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning things which edify. Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good women alike unto God. Choose for thy companions God and His Angels only, and flee from the notice of men.
36	1	I.36	36	Charitas est habenda ad omnes, sed familiaritas non expedit. Quandoque accidit ut persona ignota ex bona fama lucescit, tum præsentia oculos intuentium offuscat. Putamus aliis placere ex convictione nostra, et incipimus magis displicere morum improbitate in nobis considerata.	We must love all men, but not make close companions of all. It sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us is highly regarded through good report of him, whose actual person is nevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it. We sometimes think to please others by our intimacy, and forthwith displease them the more by the faultiness of character which they perceive in us.
37	1	I.37	37	De obedientia et subjectione.	IX Of Obedience and Subjection
38	1	I.38	38	Valde magnum est in obedientia stare, sub Prælato se vivere, et sui juris non esse. Multo tutius est stare in subjectione, quam in prælatura. Multi sunt sub obedientia magis ex necessitate, quam ex charitate, et illi poenam habent, et leviter murmurant, nec libertatem mentis acquirent, nisi ex toto corde propter Deum se subjiciant. Curre hic vel ibi non invenies requiem, nisi in humili subjectione sub Prælati regimine. Imaginatio locorum, et mutatio multos fefellit.	It is verily a great thing to live in obedience, to be under authority, and not to be at our own disposal. Far safer is it to live in subjection than in a place of authority. Many are in obedience from necessity rather than from love; these take it amiss, and repine for small cause. Nor will they gain freedom of spirit, unless with all their heart they submit themselves for the love of God. Though thou run hither and thither, thou wilt not find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him who is set over thee. Fancies about places and change of them have deceived many.
39	1	I.39	39	Verum est quod unusquisque libenter agit pro sensu suo et inclinatur ad eos magis qui secum sentiunt. Sed si Christus est inter nos, tunc necesse est, ut relinquamus etiam nostrum sentire propter bonum pacis. Quis est ita sapiens, qui omnia plene scire possit? Ergo noli nimis in sensu tuo confidere, sed velis etiam aliorum sensum audire. Si bonum est tuum sentire, et hoc ipsum propter Deum dimittis, et alium sequeris, magis inde proficies.	True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent, and is the more inclined to those who agree with him. But if Christ is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace. Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things? Therefore trust not too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hear the opinions of others. Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another, thou shalt the more profit thereby.
40	1	I.40	40	Audivi enim sæpe, securius esse audire, et accipere consilium quam dare. Potest enim contingere ut bonum fit uniuscujusque sentire, sed nolle aliis acquiescere, cum id ratio aut causa postulat, signum est superbiæ aut pertinaciæ.	Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to hearken and to receive counsel than to give it. It may also come to pass that each opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others when reason or occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or wilfulness.
41	1	I.41	41	De superfluitate verborum.	X Of the danger of superfluity of words
42	1	I.42	42	Caveas tumultum hominum, quantum potes. Multum nam impedit tractatus fæcularium gestorum, etiamsi simplici intentione proferantur. Cito enim inquinamur vanitate et captivamur. Vellem me pluries tacuisse, et inter homines non fuisse. Sed quare tam frequenter loquimur, et invicem fabulamur, cum tamen sine læsione conscientiæ raro ad silentium redimus? Ideo tam frequenter loquimur, quia per multas locutiones ad invicem consolari quærimus, et cor diversis cogitationibus fatigatum optamus relevare, et multum libenter, de his quæ diligimus, seu cupimus, vel quæ nobis sentimus contraria, libet loqui et cogitare.	Avoid as far as thou canst the tumult of men; for talk concerning worldly things, though it be innocently undertaken, is a hindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity. Many a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone amongst men. But why do we talk and gossip so continually, seeing that we so rarely resume our silence without some hurt done to our conscience? We like talking so much because we hope by our conversations to gain some mutual comfort, and because we seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts. And we very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or desire, or else of those which we most dislike.
43	1	I.43	43	Sed proh dolor sæpe inaniter, et frustra. Nam hæc exterior consolatio interioris et divinæ consolationis non modicum detrimentum est. Ideo vigilandum est et orandum ne tempus otiose transeat. Si loqui licet et expedit, quæ ædificabilia sunt loquere. Malus usus et negligentia profectus nostri multum facit ad incustodiam oris nostri. Juvat tamen non parum ad profectum spiritualem devota spiritualium rerum collatio, maxime ubi pares animo et spiritu in Deo sibi sociantur.	But alas! it is often to no purpose and in vain. For this outward consolation is no small hindrance to the inner comfort which cometh from God. Therefore must we watch and pray that time pass not idly away. If it be right and desirable for thee to speak, speak things which are to edification. Evil custom and neglect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of watching over our lips. Nevertheless, devout conversation on spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiritual progress, most of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find their ground of fellowship in God.
44	1	I.44	44	De pace quærenda, et zelo proficiendi.	XI Of seeking peace of mind and of spiritual progress
45	1	I.45	45	Multam possumus pacem habere, si volumus nos cum aliorum dictis et factis quæ ad nostram curam non spectant non occupare. Quomodo potest ille in pace die permanere, qui alienis curis se intermiscet, qui occasiones forinsecus quærit, qui parum vel raro se intrinsecur colligit? Beati simplices, quoniam multam pacem habebunt.	We may enjoy abundance of peace if we refrain from busying ourselves with the sayings and doings of others, and things which concern not ourselves. How can he abide long time in peace who occupieth himself with other men’s matters, and with things without himself, and meanwhile payeth little or rare heed to the self within? Blessed are the single-hearted, for they shall have abundance of peace.
46	1	I.46	46	Quare quidam Sanctorum tam perfecti et contemplativi fuerunt? quia mortificari omnino ab omnibus terrenis desideriis studuerunt, et ideo totis medullis cordis Deo inhærere, atque sibi libere vacare potuerunt. Nos nimium propriis occupamur passionibus, et de transitoriis nimis sollicitamur. Raro nam vitium unum perfecte vincimus, et ad quotidianum profectum non attendimus, ideo frigidi et tepidi remanemus.	How came it to pass that many of the Saints were so perfect, so contemplative of Divine things? Because they steadfastly sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires, and so were enabled to cling with their whole heart to God, and be free and at leisure for the thought of Him. We are too much occupied with our own affections, and too anxious about transitory things. Seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault, nor are we zealous for daily growth in grace. And so we remain lukewarm and unspiritual.
47	1	I.47	47	Si essemus nobismetipsis perfecte intenti, et exterius minime implicati, tunc possemus etiam divina sapere, et de cælesti contemplatione aliquid experiri. Totum et maximum impedimentum est, quia non sumus a passionibus, et concupiscentiis liberi, nec perfectam viam Sanctorum conamur ingredi. Quando etiam modicum adversitatis occurit, nimis cito dijicimur, et ad humanas consolationes convertimur.	Were we fully watchful of ourselves, and not bound in spirit to outward things, then might we be wise unto salvation, and make progress in Divine contemplation. Our great and grievous stumbling-block is that, not being freed from our affections and desires, we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the Saints. And when even a little trouble befalleth us, too quickly are we cast down, and fly to the world to give us comfort.
48	1	I.48	48	Si niteremur sicut viri fortes stare in proelio, profecto auxilium Dominii super nos videremus de cælo. Ipse nam certantes, et de sua gratia sperantes paratus est adjuvare, qui nobis certandi occasiones procurat, ut vincamus. Si tantum in istis exterioribus observantiis profectum religionis ponimus, cito finem habebit devotio nostra. Sed ad radicem securim ponamus, ut purgati a passionibus pacificam mentem possideamus.	If we would quit ourselves like men, and strive to stand firm in the battle, then should we see the Lord helping us from Heaven. For He Himself is alway ready to help those who strive and who trust in Him; yea, He provideth for us occasions of striving, to the end that we may win the victory. If we look upon our progress in religion as a progress only in outward observances and forms, our devoutness will soon come to an end. But let us lay the axe to the very root of our life, that, being cleansed from affections, we may possess our souls in peace.
49	1	I.49	49	Si omni anno unum vitium extirparemus, cito viri perfecti efficeremur. Sed modo contrario sæpe sentimus ut meliores, et puriores in initio conversionis nos fuisse inveniamus quam post multos annos prosessionis. Fervor et profectus noster quotidie deberet crescere, sed nunc pro magno videtur si quis primi fervoris partem possit retinere. Si modicam violentiam faceremus in principio, tunc omnia possemus facere cum levitate et gaudio.	If each year should see one fault rooted out from us, we should go quickly on to perfection. But on the contrary, we often feel that we were better and holier in the beginning of our conversion than after many years of profession. Zeal and progress ought to increase day by day; yet now it seemeth a great thing if one is able to retain some portion of his first ardour. If we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the beginning, then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and joy.
50	1	I.50	50	Grave est assueta dimittere, et gravius est contra propriam voluntatem ire. Sed si non vincis parva et levia, quando superabis difficiliora? Resiste in principio inclinatini tuæ, et malum defere consuetudinem, ne forte paulatim ad majorem te ducat difficultatem. O si adverteres quantum tibi pacem et aliis lætitiam faceres, temetipsum bene habendo, puto quod sollicitior esses ad spiritualem profectum.	It is a hard thing to break through a habit, and a yet harder thing to go contrary to our own will. Yet if thou overcome not slight and easy obstacles, how shalt thou overcome greater ones? Withstand thy will at the beginning, and unlearn an evil habit, lest it lead thee little by little into worse difficulties. Oh, if thou knewest what peace to thyself thy holy life should bring to thyself, and what joy to others, methinketh thou wouldst be more zealous for spiritual profit.
51	1	I.51	51	De utilitate adversitatis.	XII Of the uses of adversity
52	1	I.52	52	Bonum nobis est, quod aliquando habeamus aliquas gravitates et contrarietates, quia sæpe hominem ad cor revocant, quatenus se in exilio esse cognoscat, nec spem suam in aliqua mundi re ponat. Bonum est quod patiamur quandoque contradictiones, et male et imperfecte de nobis sentiatur, etiamsi bene agimus, et intendimus. Ista sæpe juvant ad humilitatem, et a vana gloria nos defendunt. Tunc enim melius interiorem testem Deum quærimus, quando foris vilipendimur ab hominibus, et non bene de nobis creditur.	It is good for us that we sometimes have sorrows and adversities, for they often make a man lay to heart that he is only a stranger and sojourner, and may not put his trust in any worldly thing. It is good that we sometimes endure contradictions, and are hardly and unfairly judged, when we do and mean what is good. For these things help us to be humble, and shield us from vain-glory. For then we seek the more earnestly the witness of God, when men speak evil of us falsely, and give us no credit for good.
53	1	I.53	53	Ideo deberet se homo totaliter firmare, et non esset ei necesse multas consolationes quærere. Quando homo bonæ voluntatis tribulatur vel tentatur aut malis cogitationibus affligitur, tunc Deum magis sibi necessarium intelligit, sine quo nihil omnino se posse testatur. Gemit et orat pro miseriis quas patitur. Tunc tædet eum diutius vivere, mortem optat venire, utpossit dissolvi, et esse cum Christi.Tunc etiam bene advertit securitatem et plenam pacem in mundo non posse stare.	Therefore ought a man to rest wholly upon God, so that he needeth not seek much comfort at the hand of men. When a man who feareth God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil thoughts, then he seeth that God is the more necessary unto him, since without God he can do no good thing. Then he is heavy of heart, he groaneth, he crieth out for the very disquietness of his heart. Then he groweth weary of life, and would fain depart and be with Christ. By all this he is taught that in the world there can be no perfect security or fulness of peace.
54	1	I.54	54	De resistendis tentationibus.	XIII Of resisting temptation
55	1	I.55	55	Quamdiu in mundo vivimus sine tribulatione et tentatione esse non possumus. Unde in Job scriptum est:Tentatio est vita hominis super terram.Ideo unusquisque sollicitus esse deberet circa tentationes suas, et vigilare in orationibus, ne Diabolus inveniret locum decipiendi, qui nunquam dormitat, sedcircuit quærens quem devoret.Nemo tam sanctus et perfectus est, qui non habeat aliquando tentationes, et plene eis carere non possimus.	So long as we live in the world, we cannot be without trouble and trial. Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the earth is a trial. And therefore ought each of us to give heed concerning trials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest the devil find occasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but goeth about seeking whom he may devour. No man is so perfect in holiness that he hath never temptations, nor can we ever be wholly free from them.
56	1	I.56	56	Sunt tamen tentationes hominibus valde utiles, licet molestæ sint et graves, quia in his homo humiliatur, purgatur et eruditur. Omnes Sancti per multas tribulationes et tentationes transierunt et profecerunt, et qui tentationes sustinere nequiverunt, reprobi facti sunt, et defecerunt. Non est aliquis ordo tam sanctus, et locus tam secretus, ubi non sint tentationes et adversitates.	Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our profit, even though they be great and hard to bear; for through them we are humbled, purified, instructed. All Saints have passed through much tribulation and temptation, and have profited thereby. And they who endured not temptation became reprobate and fell away. There is no position so sacred, no place so secret, that it is without temptations and adversities.
57	1	I.57	57	Non est homo securus a tentationibus totaliter, quam diu vixerit, quia in nobis est unde tentamur. Ex quo in concupiscentia nati sumus, una tribulatione vel tentatione recedene alia supervenit, et semper aliquid ad patiendum habemus. Nam bonum felicitatis perdidimus. Multi quærunt tentationes fugere, et gravius incidunt in eas. Per solam fugam non possumus vincere, sed per patientiam et veram humilitatem, omnibus hositbus efficimur fortiores.	There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves, in that we are born in concupiscence. One temptation or sorrow passeth, and another cometh; and always we shall have somewhat to suffer, for we have fallen from perfect happiness. Many who seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply into them. By flight alone we cannot overcome, but by endurance and true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies.
58	1	I.58	58	Qui tantummodo exterius declinat, nec radicem evellit, parum proficiet, imo citius ad eum tentationes redient, et pejus sævient. Paulatim, et per patientiam cum longanimitate Deo juvante melius superabis, quam cum duritia et importunitate propria. Sæpe accipe consilium in tentatione, et cum tentato noli duriter agere, sed consolationes ingere, sicut tibi optares fieri.	He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the root, shall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to him the more quickly, and will be the more terrible. Little by little, through patience and long-suffering, thou shalt conquer by the help of God, rather than by violence and thine own strength of will. In the midst of temptation often seek counsel; and deal not hardly with one who is tempted, but comfort and strengthen him as thou wouldest have done unto thyself.
59	1	I.59	59	Initium omnium malarum tentationum inconstantia animi est, et parva ad Deum confidentia, quia sicut navis sine gubernaculo hinc inde a fluctibus impellitur, ita homo remissus, et suum propositum deferens varie tentatur. Ignis probat ferrum, et tentatio hominem justum. Nescimus sæpe quid possumus, sed tentatio aperit quid sumus. Vigilandum tum præcipue circa initium tentationis, quia tunc facilius hostis vincitur, si ostium mentis nullatenus intrare finitur, sed extra limen statim ut pulsaverit illi obviatur. Unde quidam dixit,Principiis obsta, sero medicina paratur.Nam primo occurrit menti simplex cogitatio, deinde fortis imaginatio, postea delectatio, et motus pravus, et assensio, sicque paulatim hostis malignus ex toto ingreditur, dum illi non resistitur in pricipio. Et quanto diutius ad resistendum quis torpuerit, tanto in se quotidie debilior fit, et hostis contra eum potentior.	The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of temper and want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a helm is tossed about by the waves, so is a man who is careless and infirm of purpose tempted, now on this side, now on that. As fire testeth iron, so doth temptation the upright man. Oftentimes we know not what strength we have; but temptation revealeth to us what we are. Nevertheless, we must watch, especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe the more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within the mind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked. Wherefore one saith, Check the beginnings; once thou might’st have cured, But now ’tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured. For first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the strong imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent. And so little by little the enemy entereth in altogether, because he was not resisted at the beginning. And the longer a man delayeth his resistance, the weaker he groweth, and the stronger groweth the enemy against him.
60	1	I.60	60	Quidam in principio conversionis suæ graviores tentationes patiuntur, quidam in fine, quidam quasi per totam vitam suam male habent. Nonnulli fatis leviter tentantur, secundum divinæ ordinationis sapientiam et æquitatem, quæ statum, et hominum merita pensat, et cuncta ad electorum suorum salutem præordinat.	Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the beginning of their conversion, some at the end. Some are sorely tried their whole life long. Some there are who are tempted but lightly, according to the wisdom and justice of the ordering of God, who knoweth the character and circumstances of men, and ordereth all things for the welfare of His elect.
61	1	I.61	61	Ideo non debemus desperare, cum tentamur, sed eo ferventius Deum exorare, quatenus dignetur in omni tribulatione nostra nos adjuvare, qui utique, secundum dictum S. Pauli,etiam faciet cum tentatione proventum, ut possimus sustinere.Humiliemus ergo animas nostras sub manu Dei in omni tentatione et tribulatione, quia humiles spiritu salvabit, et exultabit.	Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the more fervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to help us in all our tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul saith, with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it. Let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God in all temptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt such as are of an humble spirit.
62	1	I.62	62	In tentationibus et tribulationibus probatur homo quantum profecit, et ibi majus meritum existit, et virtus melius patescit. Nec magnum est, si homo devotus fit, et fervidus, cum gravitatem non sentit, sed si tempore adversitatis patienter se sustinet, spes magni profectus erit. Quidam a magnis tentationibus custodiuntur, et in quotidianis tam sæpe vincuntur, ut humiliati, nunquam de se ipsis in magnis confidant, qui in tam modicis infirmantur.	In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue doth the more appear. Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he behave himself patiently in the time of adversity, then is there hope of great progress. Some are kept safe from great temptations, but are overtaken in those which are little and common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to themselves in great things, being weak in small things.
63	1	I.63	63	De temerario judicio vitando.	XIV On avoiding rash judgment
64	1	I.64	64	Ad te ipsum oculos reflecte et aliorum facta caveas judicare. In judicando alios homo frustra laborat, sæpius errat, et leviter peccat. Se ipsum vero judicando et discutiendo semper fructuose laborat. Sicut nobis res cordi est, sic de ea frequenter judicamus. Nam verum judicium propter privatum amorem faciliter perdimus. Si Deus semper esset pura intentio desiderii nostri, non tam faciliter turbaremur pro resistentia sensus nostri.	Look well unto thyself, and beware that thou judge not the doings of others. In judging others a man laboureth in vain; he often erreth, and easily falleth into sin; but in judging and examining himself he always laboureth to good purpose. According as a matter toucheth our fancy, so oftentimes do we judge of it; for easily do we fail of true judgment because of our own personal feeling. If God were always the sole object of our desire, we should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgment of our fancy.
65	1	I.65	65	Sed semper aliquid ab intra latet, vel etaim ab extra concurrit, quod nos etiam pariter trahit. Multi occulte se ipsos quærunt in rebus, quas agunt, et nesciunt. Videntur etiam in bona pace stare, quum res pro eorum velle fiunt. Propter diversitatem sensuum, et opinionum satis frequenter oriuntur diffensiones inter amicos et cives, inter religiosos et devotos.	But often some secret thought lurking within us, or even some outward circumstance, turneth us aside. Many are secretly seeking their own ends in what they do, yet know it not. They seem to live in good peace of mind so long as things go well with them, and according to their desires, but if their desires be frustrated and broken, immediately they are shaken and displeased. Diversity of feelings and opinions very often brings about dissensions between friends, between countrymen, between religious and godly men.
66	1	I.66	66	Antiqua consuetudo difficulter relinquitur et ultra proprium videre nemo libenter ducitur. Si rationi tuæ magis inniteris vel industriæ, quam virtuti subjectivæ Jesu Christi, raro et trade eris homo illuminatus, quia Deus vult nos sibi perfecte subjicii, et omnem rationem per inflammatum amorem transcendere.	Established custom is not easily relinquished, and no man is very easily led to see with the eyes of another. If thou rest more upon thy own reason or experience than upon the power of Jesus Christ, thy light shall come slowly and hardly; for God willeth us to be perfectly subject unto Himself, and all our reason to be exalted by abundant love towards Him.
67	1	I.67	67	De operibus ex charitate factis.	XV Of works of charity
68	1	I.68	68	Pro nulla re mundi, et pro nullius hominis dilectione aliquod malum est faciendum. Sed pro utilitate indigentis bonum opus aliquando intermittendum aut quandoque pro meliori mutandum. Hoc nam facto opus bonum non destruitur, sed in melius commutatur. Sine charitate opus externum non prodest quemquam. Quicquid autem ex charitate agitur quantumcumque etiam parvum sit, et despectum totum efficitur fructuosum. Magis si quidem Deus pensat ex quanto quis agit, quam quantum quis facit.	For no worldly good whatsoever, and for the love of no man, must anything be done which is evil, but for the help of the suffering a good work must sometimes be postponed, or be changed for a better; for herein a good work is not destroyed, but improved. Without charity no work profiteth, but whatsoever is done in charity, however small and of no reputation it be, bringeth forth good fruit; for God verily considereth what a man is able to do, more than the greatness of what he doth.
69	1	I.69	69	Multum quis facit, qui multum diligit. Multum facit qui rem bene facit. Bene facit, qui magis communitati, quam suæ voluntati fervit. Sæpe videtur esse charitas, et est magis carnalitas, quia carnalis inclinatio, propria voluntas, spes retributionis, affectus voluntatis raro abesse volunt.	He doth much who loveth much. He doth much who doth well. He doth well who ministereth to the public good rather than to his own. Oftentimes that seemeth to be charity which is rather carnality, because it springeth from natural inclination, self-will, hope of repayment, desire of gain.
70	1	I.70	70	Qui veram et perfectam charitatem habet, in nulla re se ipsum quærit, sed Dei solummodo gloriam in omnibus fieri desiderat. Nulli etiam invidet, quia nullum privatum gaudium amat, nec in se ipso vult gaudere, sed in Deo super omnia optat bona beatificari. Nemini aliquid boni attribuit, sed totaliter ad Deum refert tota, unde omnia procedunt. In quo finaliter omnes Sancti fruibiliter quiescunt. O qui scintillam haberet veræ charitatis, perfecte omnia terrena sentiret plena vanitatis.	He who hath true and perfect charity, in no wise seeketh his own good, but desireth that God alone be altogether glorified. He envieth none, because he longeth for no selfish joy; nor doth he desire to rejoice in himself, but longeth to be blessed in God as the highest good. He ascribeth good to none save to God only, the Fountain whence all good proceedeth, and the End, the Peace, the joy of all Saints. Oh, he who hath but a spark of true charity, hath verily learned that all worldly things are full of vanity.
71	1	I.71	71	De sufferentia defectuum aliorum.	XVI Of bearing with the faults of others
72	1	I.72	72	Quæ rarissime homo in se vel in aliis emendare non valet, debet patienter sustinere, donec Deus aliter ordinet. Cogita quod sic forte melius est pro tua probatione et patientia, sine qua non sunt multum ponderanda merita nostra. Debes tamen pro talibus impedimentis supplicare, ut tibi dignetur Deus subvenire, ut possis benigne portare.	Those things which a man cannot amend in himself or in others, he ought patiently to bear, until God shall otherwise ordain. Bethink thee that perhaps it is better for thy trial and patience, without which our merits are but little worth. Nevertheless thou oughtest, when thou findeth such impediments, to beseech God that He would vouchsafe to sustain thee, that thou be able to bear them with a good will.
73	1	I.73	73	Si quis semel vel bis admonitus non acquiescit, noli cum eo contendere, sed totum Deo committe, ut fiat voluntas sua, et honor in omnibus servis suis, qui scit bene, malum in bonum convertere. Stude patiens esse in tolerando aliorum defectus, et qualescumque infirmitates, quia et tu multa habes, quæ ab aliis oportet tolerari. Si non potes te talem facere qualem vis, quomodo poteris alium habere ad beneplacitum tuum? Libenter videmus alios perfectos, sed tamen proprios non emendamus defectus.	If one who is once or twice admonished refuse to hearken, strive not with him, but commit all to God, that His will may be done and His honour be shown in His servants, for He knoweth well how to convert the evil unto good. Endeavour to be patient in bearing with other men’s faults and infirmities whatsoever they be, for thou thyself also hast many things which have need to be borne with by others. If thou canst not make thine own self what thou desireth, how shalt thou be able to fashion another to thine own liking. We are ready to see others made perfect, and yet we do not amend our own shortcomings.
74	1	I.74	74	Volumus quod alii districte corrigantur, et nos ipsi corrigi nolumus, aut negari quod petimus. Alios restringi per statuta volumus, et ipsi nullatenus patimur amplius cohiberi. Sic ergo patet, quam raro proximum, sicut nos ipsos pensamus. Si omnes essent perfecti quid tunc haberemus ab aliis pro Deo pati?	We will that others be straitly corrected, but we will not be corrected ourselves. The freedom of others displeaseth us, but we are dissatisfied that our own wishes shall be denied us. We desire rules to be made restraining others, but by no means will we suffer ourselves to be restrained. Thus therefore doth it plainly appear how seldom we weigh our neighbour in the same balance with ourselves. If all men were perfect, what then should we have to suffer from others for God?
75	1	I.75	75	Nunc autem Deus sic ordinavit, ut discamusalter alterius onera portare,quia nemo sine defectu, nemo sine onere, nemo sibi sufficiens, nemo sibi satis sapiens, sed oportet invicem portare, invicem consolari, pariter adjuvare, et ammonere. Quantas autem virtutes quisque fecerit, melius patet occasione adversitatis. Occasiones namque hominem fragilem non faciunt, sed qualis sit, ostendunt.	But now hath God thus ordained, that we may learn to bear one another’s burdens, because none is without defect, none without a burden, none sufficient of himself, none wise enough of himself; but it behoveth us to bear with one another, to comfort one another, to help, instruct, admonish one another. How much strength each man hath is best proved by occasions of adversity: for such occasions do not make a man frail, but show of what temper he is.
76	1	I.76	76	De monastica vita.	XVII Of a Religious life
77	1	I.77	77	Oportet ut discas te ipsum in multis frangere, si vis pacem et concordiam cum aliis tenere. Non est parvum in monasteriis, vel in congregatione habitare, et in illis sine querela conversari, et usque ad mortem fidelis perseverare. Beatus qui ibidem bene visit, et feliciter consummavit. Si vis debite stare et proficere, teneas te tanquam exulem et peregrinum super terram. Oportet te stultum fieri propter Christum, si vis religiosam ducere vitam.	It behoveth thee to learn to mortify thyself in many things, if thou wilt live in amity and concord with other men. It is no small thing to dwell in a religious community or congregation, and to live there without complaint, and therein to remain faithful even unto death. Blessed is he who hath lived a good life in such a body, and brought it to a happy end. If thou wilt stand fast and wilt profit as thou oughtest, hold thyself as an exile and a pilgrim upon the earth. Thou wilt have to be counted as a fool for Christ, if thou wilt lead a religious life.
78	1	I.78	78	Habitus et tonsura modicum faciunt, sed mutatio morum et integra mortificatio passionem verum faciunt religiosum. Qui aliud quærit, quam pure Deum, et animæ suæ salutem, non inveniet nisi tribulationem et dolorem. Non potest etiam diu stare pacificus, qui non nititur esse minimus, et omnibus subjectus. Ad serviendum venisti, non ad regendum, ad paciendum et laborandum scias te vocatum, non ad otiandum, vel fabulandum. Hic ergo probantur homines sicut aurum in fornace. Hic nemo potest stare nisi ex toto corde si voluerit propter Deum humiliare.	The clothing and outward appearance are of small account; it is change of character and entire mortification of the affections which make a truly religious man. He who seeketh aught save God and the health of his soul, shall find only tribulation and sorrow. Nor can he stand long in peace, who striveth not to be least of all and servant of all. 3. Thou art called to endure and to labour, not to a life of ease and trifling talk. Here therefore are men tried as gold in the furnace. No man can stand, unless with all his heart he will humble himself for God’s sake.
79	1	I.79	79	De exemplo Sanctorum Patrum.	XVIII Of the example of the holy fathers
80	1	I.80	80	Intuere Sanctorum Patrum vivida exempla, in quibus vera perfectio fulsit, et videbis quam modicum sit, et vere nihil, quod nos agimus. Heu quid est vita nostra, si illis fuerit comparata. Sancti et amici Christi Domino servierunt in fame et siti, in frigore et nuditate, in labore et fatigatine, in vigiliis et jejuniis, in orationibus et sanctis meditationibus, in persecutionibus et opprobriis multis.	Consider now the lively examples of the holy fathers, in whom shone forth real perfectness and religion, and thou shalt see how little, even as nothing, is all that we do. Ah! What is our life when compared to theirs? They, saints and friends of Christ as they were, served the Lord in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, in labour and weariness, in watchings and fastings, in prayer and holy meditations, in persecutions and much rebuke.
81	1	I.81	81	O quam multas, et graves tribulationes passi sunt Apostoli, Martyres et Confessores, Virginies et reliqui omnes, qui Christi vestigia voluerunt sequi. Nam animas suas in hoc mundo oderunt, ut in vitam æternam eas possiderent. O quam strictam et abdicatam vitam sancti Patres in eremo duxerunt, quam longas, et graves tentationes pertulerunt: quam frequenter ab inimico vexati sunt, quam graves, et fervidas orationes Deo obtulerunt, quam rigidas abstinentias peregerunt, quam magnum zelum, et fervorem ad spiritualem profectum habuerunt, quam forte bellum adversus edomationem vitiorum gesserunt, quam puram, et rectam intentionem ad Deum tenuerunt, per diem laborabant, et noctibus orationi diutinæ vacabant: quamquam laborando ab oratione mentali minime cessarent.	O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would walk in the footsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in this world that they might keep them unto life eternal. O how strict and retired a life was that of the holy fathers who dwelt in the desert! what long and grievous temptations they did suffer! how often were they assaulted by the enemy! what frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God! what strict fasts did they endure! what fervent zeal and desire after spiritual profit did they manifest! how bravely did they fight that their vices might not gain the mastery! how entirely and steadfastly did they reach after God! By day they laboured, and at night they gave themselves ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even when they were labouring they ceased not from mental prayer.
82	1	I.82	82	Omne tempus utiliter expendebant, omnis hora ad vacandum Deo brevis videbatur. Et præ magna dulcedine contemplationis, etiam oblivioni tradebatur necessitas corporalis refectionis. Omnibus divitiis, dignitatibus, honoribus, amicis et cognatis renuntiabant. Nihil de mundo habere cupiebant: vix necessaria vitæ sumebant, corpori servire etiam in necessitate dolebant. Pauperes igitur erant rebus terrenis, sed divites valde in gratia, et virtutibus. Foris egebant, sed intus gratia, et consolatione divina reficiebantur.	They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed short for retirement with God; and through the great sweetness of contemplation, even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten. They renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen; they desired nothing from the world; they ate the bare necessaries of life; they were unwilling to minister to the body even in necessity. Thus were they poor in earthly things, but rich above measure in grace and virtue. Though poor to the outer eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly benedictions.
83	1	I.83	83	Mundo erant alieni, sed Deo proximi, ac familiares amici. Sibi ipsis videbantur tanquam nihili, et huic mundo dispecti, sed erant in oculis Dei prætiosi, et delecti. In vera humilitate stabant, in simplici obedientia vivebant, in charitate et patientia ambulabant, et ideo quotidie proficiebant, et magnam apud Deum obtinebant gratiam. Dati sunt in exemplum omnibus Religiosis et plus provocare nos debent ad bene proficiendum, quam tepidorum numerus ad relaxandum.	They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as kinsmen and friends. They seemed unto themselves as of no reputation, and in the world’s eyes contemptible; but in the sight of God they were precious and beloved. They stood fast in true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in love and patience; and thus they waxed strong in spirit, and obtained great favour before God. To all religious men they were given as an example, and they ought more to provoke us unto good livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to carelessness of life.
84	1	I.84	84	O, quantus fervor omnium Religiosorum in principio suæ sanctæ institutionis fuit; o, quanta devotio orationis, quanta æmulatio virtutis, quam magna disciplina viguit, quanta reverentia et obedientia sub regula in omnibus floruit. Testantur adhuc vestigia derelicta, quod vere viri sancti et perfecti fuerunt, qui tam strenue militantes, mundum suppeditaverunt. Jam magnus utique putatur, si quis transgressor non fuerit, si quis quod accepit cum patientia tolerare potuerit.	O how great was the love of all religious persons at the beginning of this sacred institution! O what devoutness of prayer! what rivalry in holiness! what strict discipline was observed! what reverence and obedience under the rule of the master showed they in all things! The traces of them that remain until now testify that they were truly holy and perfect men, who fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot. Now a man is counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he can only endure with patience what he hath undertak
85	1	I.85	85	O, tepor et negligentia status nostri, quod tam cito declinamus a pristino fervore et jam tædet vivere præ lassitudine et tepore. Utinam in te penitus non dormiret profectus virtutum, qui multa sæpius exempla vidisti devotorum.	O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly decline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to live, because of sloth and lukewarmness. May progress in holiness not wholly fall asleep in thee, who many times hast seen so many examples of devout men!
86	1	I.86	86	De exercitiis boni Religiosi.	XIX Of the exercises of a religious man
87	1	I.87	87	Vita boni Religiosi omnibus virtutibus pollere debet, ut sit talis interius qualis ab hominibus videtur exterius. Et multo plus debet esse intus, quam quod cernitur foris, quia inspector noster est Deus quem summopere revereri debemus ubicumque fuerimus, et tamquam Angeli in conspectu ejus mundi incedere. Omni die renovare debemus propositum nostrum, et ad fervorem nos excitare, quasi hodie primum ad conversionem venissemus ac dicere: Adjuva me Deus in bono proposito et sancto fervitio tuo, et da mihi nunc hodie perfecte incipere, quia nihil est, quod hactenus feci.	The life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues, that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men. And verily it should be yet better within than without, for God is a discerner of our heart, Whom we must reverence with all our hearts wheresoever we are, and walk pure in His presence as do the angels. We ought daily to renew our vows, and to kindle our hearts to zeal, as if each day were the first day of our conversion, and to say, “Help me, O God, in my good resolutions, and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may make a good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!”
88	1	I.88	88	Secundum propositum nostrum est cursus profectus nostri, et multa diligentia opus est bene proficere volenti. Quod si fortiter proponens sæpe deficit, quid faciet ille qui raro aut minus fixe aliquid proponit? Variis tamen modis contingit defertio propositi nostri. Et levis omissio exercitiorum vix sine aliquo dispendio transit. Justorum propositum in gratia potius Dei, quam in propria patientia pendet. In quo et semper confidunt quidquid arripiunt. Nam homo proponit, sed Deus disponit,nec est in homine via ejus.	According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress, and much diligence is needful for him who would make good progress. For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly? But manifold causes bring about abandonment of our resolution, yet a trivial omission of holy exercises can hardly be made without some loss to us. The resolution of the righteous dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own wisdom; for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in hand. For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a man is not in himself.
89	1	I.89	89	Si pietatis causa, aut fraternæ utilitatis proposito, quandoque consuetum omittitur exercitium, facile postea poterit recuperari. Si autem tædio animi, vel negligentia faciliter relinquitur, satis culpabile est et nocivum sentitur. Conemur quantum possumus, adhuc leviter deficiemus in multis. Semper tamen aliquid certi proponendum est, et proponenda sunt illa præcipue quæ amplius nos impediunt. Exteriora nostra et interiora pariter nobis scrutanda sunt, et ordinanda, quia utraque expediunt ad proprium profectum.	If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some act of piety, or of some brotherly kindness, it can easily be taken up afterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or slothfulness, then is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt. Strive as earnestly as we may, we shall still fall short in many things. Always should some distinct resolution be made by us; and, most of all, we must strive against those sins which most easily beset us. Both our outer and inner life should be straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to do with our progress.
90	1	I.90	90	Si non continue te vales colligere, saltem interdum, et ad minus semel in die, mane videlicet aut vespere. Mane propone, vespere discute mores tuos, qualis hodie fuisti in verbo, opere et cogitatione, quia in his forsan Deum sæpius offendisti ex proximum. Accinge te sicut vir fortis contra diabolicas nequitias, fræna gulam et omnem carnis inclinatinem facilius frænabis. Numquam sis ex toto otiosus, sed aut legens, aut scribens, aut orans, aut meditans, aut aliquid utilitatis pro communi laborans. Corporalia tamen exercitia discrete sunt agenda, nec omnibus æqualiter assumenda.	If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at certain seasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at morning. In the morning make thy resolves, and in the evening inquire into thy life, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed, and thought; for in these ways thou hast often perchance offended God and thy neighbour. Gird up thy lions like a man against the assaults of the devil; bridle thine appetite, and thou wilt soon be able to bridle every inclination of the flesh. Be thou never without something to do; be reading, or writing, or praying, or meditating, or doing something that is useful to the community. Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with discretion, nor are they to be used by all alike.
91	1	I.91	91	Quæ communia non sunt, non sunt foris ostendenda, nam in secreto tutius exercentur privata. Cavendum tamen ne piger sis ad communia, et ad singularia promptior. Sed expletis integre et fideliter debitis, et injunctis, si jam ultra tempus vacat, redde te tibi, prout tua devotio desiderat. Non possunt omnes habere exercitium unum, sed aliud isti, aliud illi magis deservit, et pro temporis congruentia diversa placent exercitia, quia alia in festis, alia in feriatis magis sapiunt diebus, aliis indigemus tempore tentationis, et aliis tempore pacis et quietis. Alia, cum tristamur, libet cogitare, et alia, cum læti in Domino fuerimus.	The duties which are not common to all must not be done openly, but are safest carried on in secret. But take heed that thou be not careless in the common duties, and more devout in the secret; but faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and commands which lie upon thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still leisure, give thyself to thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee. All cannot have one exercise, but one suiteth better to this man and another to that. Even for the diversity of season different exercises are needed, some suit better for feasts, some for fasts. We need one kind in time of temptations and others in time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times of sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord.
92	1	I.92	92	Circa principalia festa renovanda sunt bona exercitia, et Sanctorum suffragia ferventius imploranda. De festo in festum proponere debemus quasi tunc de sæculo migraturi, et ad æternum festum perventuri. Ideoque sollicite nos præparare debemus in devotis temporibus, et devotius conversari, atque omnem observantiam strictius custodire, tanquam in brevi laboris nostri præmium a Deo percepturi.	When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises should be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently besought. We ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to another, as if each were the period of our departure from this world, and of entering into the eternal feast. So ought we to prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn seasons, and the more solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch upon each holy observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward of our labours at the hand of God.
93	1	I.93	93	Et si dilatum fuerit, credamus nos minus bene paratos, atque indignos tantæ gloriæ, quæ revelabitur in nobis tempore præfinito et studeamus nos melius ad exitum præparare.Beatus servusait Evangelista Lucas,quem, cum venerit Dominus, invenerit vigilantem. Amen dico vobis, super omnia bona sua constituet eum.	And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet ill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be revealed in us at the appointed season; and let us study to prepare ourselves the better for our end. Blessed is that servant, as the Evangelist Luke hath it, whom, when the Lord cometh He shall find watching. Verily I say unto you He will make him ruler over all that He hath.
94	1	I.94	94	De amore solitudinis et silentii.	XX Of the love of solitude and silence
95	1	I.95	95	Quære aptum tempus vacandi tibi, de beneficiis Dei frequenter cogita. Relinque curiosa, tales potius perlege materias, quæ compunctionem magis præstent quam occupationem. Si te subtraxeris a superfluis locutionibus et curiosis circuitionibus nec non a novitatibus et remoribus audiendis, invenies tempus sufficiens et aptum bonis meditationibus insistendis. Maximi Sanctorum humana consortia ubi poterant vitabant et Deo in secreto vivere eligebant.	Seek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of the mercies of God to thee. Leave curious questions. Study such matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement. If thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings about, as well as from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy time sufficient and apt for good meditation. The greatest saints used to avoid as far as they could the company of men, and chose to live in secret with God.
96	1	I.96	96	Dixit quidam:Quoties inter homines fui, minor homo redii.Hoc sæpius experimur, quando diu confabulamur. Facilius est enim tacere quam in verbo non excedere. Facilius est domi latere quam foris se posse sufficienter custodire. Qui igitur intendit ad interiora et spiritualia pervenire, oportet eum cum Jesu a turba declinare. Nemo secure apparet nisi qui libenter latet. Nemo secure præcipit nisi qui obedire didicit. Nemo secure gaudet nisi qui testimonium bonæ conscienitæ habet.	One hath said, “As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I returned less a man.” This is what we often experience when we have been long time in conversation. For it is easier to be altogether silent than it is not to exceed in word. It is easier to remain hidden at home than to keep sufficient guard upon thyself out of doors. He, therefore, that seeketh to reach that which is hidden and spiritual, must go with Jesus “apart from the multitude.” No man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to rest at home. No man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace. No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject. No man safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey.
97	1	I.97	97	Semper tamen Sanctorum securitas plena timoris Dei extitit. Nec eo minus solliciti et humiles in se fuerunt, quia magnis virtutibus et gratia emicuerunt. Pravorum autem securitas ex superbia et præsumptione oritur et in fine in desperationem sui vertitur. Nunquam promittas tibi securitatem in hac vita, quamvis bonus videaris Coenobita, aut bonus Eremita.	No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a good conscience within himself. The boldness of the Saints was always full of the fear of God. Nor were they the less earnest and humble in themselves, because they shone forth with great virtues and grace. But the boldness of wicked men springeth from pride and presumption, and at the last turneth to their own confusion. Never promise thyself security in this life, howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest.
98	1	I.98	98	Sæpe meliores in existimatione hominum magis periclitati sunt propter nimiam suam confidentiam. Unde multum utilius est, ut non penitus tentationibus careant, sed sæpius impugnentur ne nimium securi sint, ne forte in superbiam eleventur, ne etiam ad exteriores consolationes licentius declinent. O, qui nunquam transitoriam lætitiam quæreret, qui nunquam cum mundo se occuparet, quam bonam conscientiam servaret. O, qui omnem vanam sollicitudinem amputaret, et duntaxat salutaria ac divina cogitaret, et totam spem suam in Domino constitueret, quam magnam pacem et quietem possideret.	Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the more grievously because of their over great confidence. Wherefore it is very profitable unto many that they should not be without inward temptation, but should be frequently assaulted, lest they be over confident, lest they be indeed lifted up into pride, or else lean too freely upon the consolations of the world. O how good a conscience should that man keep, who never sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled with the world! O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and divine things, and build his whole hope upon God!
99	1	I.99	99	Nemo dignus est cælesti consolatione, nisi diligenter se exercuerit in sancta compunctione. Si vis corde tenus compungi, intra cubiculum tuum, et exclude tumultus mundi. Sicut scriptum est,In cubilibus vestris compungimini.In cella invenies, quod de foris sæpius amittes. Cella continuata dulcescit et male custodita tædium generat. Si in principio conversationis tuæ bene eam incolueris, et custodieris, erit postea tibi amica dilecta, et gratissimum solatium.	No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath diligently exercised himself in holy compunction. If thou wilt feel compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and shut out the tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with your own heart in your own chamber and be still.In retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad. Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet, but if thou keep not in it, begetteth weariness. If in the beginning of thy conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well, it shall afterwards be to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant solace.
100	1	I.100	100	In silentio et quiete proficit anima devota, et discit abscondita Scripturarum. Ibi invenit fluenta lacrymarum, quibus singulis noctibus se lavet et mundet, ut Conditori suo tanto familiarior fiat, quanto longius ab omni sæculari tumultu degit. Qui ergo se substrahit a notis et amicis, approximabit illi Deus cum Angelis sanctis. Melius est latere et sui curam agere, quam se neglecto signa facere. Laudabile est homini religioso raro foras ire, fugere videri et nolle homines videre.	In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and learneth the hidden things of the Scriptures. Therein findeth she a fountain of tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each night, that she may grow the more dear to her Maker as she dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction. To him who withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and friends God with his holy angels will draw nigh. It is better to be unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders. It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad, to fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men.
101	1	I.101	101	Quid vis videre, quod non licet habere?Transit mundus, et concupiscentia ejus.Trahunt desideria sensualitatis ad spatiandum. Sed cum hora transierit, quid nisi gravitatem conscientiæ, et cordis dispersionem portat? Lætus exitus tristem sæpe reditum parit et læta vigilia serotina triste mane facit. Sic omne carnale gaudium blande intrat, sed in fine mordet et perimit.	Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have? The world passeth away and the lust thereof. The desires of sensuality draw thee abroad, but when an hour is past, what dost thou bring home, but a weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart? A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning? So doth all carnal joy begin pleasantly, but in the end it gnaweth away and destroyeth. What canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at home? Behold the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out of these are all things made.
102	1	I.102	102	Quid potes videre alicubi, quod die potest sub solem permanere. Credis te forsitan satiari, sed non poteris pertingere. Si cuncta videres præsentia, quid esset, nisi visio vana? Leva oculos tuos ad Deum in excelsis, et ora pro peccatis tuis, et negligentiis. Dimitte vana vanis, tu autem intende illis, quæ tibi præcepit Deus. Claude super te ostium tuum, et voca ad te Jesum dilectum tuum. Mane cum eo in cella, quia non invenies alibi tantam pacem. Si non exisses nec quidquam de rumoribus audisses, melius in bona pace permansisses. Ex quo nova delectaris aliquando audire, oportet te exinde turbationem cordis tolerare.	What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the sun? Thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but thou wilt never be able to attain unto this. If thou shouldest see all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain vision? Lift up thine eyes to God on high, and pray that thy sins and negligences may be forgiven. Leave vain things to vain men, and mind thou the things which God hath commanded thee. Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself Jesus thy beloved. Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not elsewhere find so great peace. If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace. But because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou must therefore suffer trouble of heart.
103	1	I.103	103	De compunctione cordis.	XXI Of compunction of heart
104	1	I.104	104	Si vis aliquid proficere, conserva te in timore Dei et noli esse nimis liber. Sed sub disciplina cohibe omnes sensus tuos, nec ineptæ te tradas lætitiæ, da te ad cordis compunctionem, et invenies devotionem; compunctio multa bona aperit, quæ dissolutio cito perdere consuevit. Mirum est, quod homo possit unquam perfecte lætari in hac vita, qui suum exilium, et tam multa pericula animæ suæ considerat, et pensat.	If thou wilt make any progress keep thyself in the fear of God, and long not to be too free, but restrain all thy senses under discipline and give not thyself up to senseless mirth. Give thyself to compunction of heart and thou shalt find devotion. Compunction openeth the way for many good things, which dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose. It is wonderful that any man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who considereth and weigheth his banishment, and the manifold dangers which beset his soul.
105	1	I.105	105	Propter levitatem cordis et negligentiam defectuum nosrorum non senstimus animæ nostræ dolores, sed sæpe vane reddimus verba, quandomerito flere deberemus. Non est vera libertas, nec bona conscientia, nisi in timore Dei. Felix qui abjicere potest omne impedimentum distractionis, et ad unionem se redigere sanctæ compunctionis. Felix qui a se abdicat quidquid suam conscientiam maculare potest, vel gravare. Certa viriliter. Consuetudo consuetudine vincitur. Si tu scis homies dimittere, ipsi bene dimittent te, tua facta facere.	Through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we feel not the sorrows of our soul, but often vainly laugh when we have good cause to weep. There is no true liberty nor real joy, save in the fear of God with a good conscience. Happy is he who can cast away every cause of distraction and bring himself to the one purpose of holy compunction. Happy is he who putteth away from him whatsoever may stain or burden his conscience. Strive manfully; custom is overcome by custom. If thou knowest how to let men alone, they will gladly let thee alone to do thine own works.
106	1	I.106	106	Non attrahas tibi res aliorum, nec te implices causis majorum. Habeas semper oculum super te primum, et admoneas te ipsum specialiter, præ omnibus tibi dilectis. Si non habes favorem hominum noli exinde tristari, sed hoc tibi sit grave quia non habes te satis bene et circumspecte, sicut deceret servum Dei et devotum Religiosum conversari. Utilius est sæpe et securius, quod homo non habeat multas consolationes in hac vita secudum carnem, præcipue tamen, quod divinas non habemus, aut rarius sentimus nos devotos; in culpa sumus, quia compunctionem non quærimus cordis, ac vanas et extrinsecas non abjicimus.	Busy not thyself with the affairs of others, nor entangle thyself with the business of great men. Keep always thine eye upon thyself first of all, and give advice to thyself specially before all thy dearest friends. If thou hast not the favour of men, be not thereby cast down, but let thy concern be that thou holdest not thyself so well and circumspectly, as becometh a servant of God and a devout monk. It is often better and safer for a man not to have many comforts in this life, especially those which concern the flesh. But that we lack divine comforts or feel them rarely is to our own blame, because we seek not compunction of heart, nor utterly cast away those comforts which are vain and worldly.
107	1	I.107	107	Cognosce te indignum divina consolatione, sed magis dignum multa tribulatione. Quando homo perfecte est compunctus, tunc gravis et amarus est ei totus mundus. Bonus homo sufficientem invenit materiam dolendi et flendi: sive enim considerat se, sive de proximo pensat; scit quia nemo sine tribulatione hic vivit; et quanto strictius sese considerat, tanto amplius dolet. Materiæ justi doloris, et internæ compunctionis sunt peccata, et vitia nostra, quibus ita involuti jacemus, ut raro cælistia contemplari valeamus.	Know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation, and worthy rather of much tribulation. When a man hath perfect compunction, then all the world is burdensome and bitter to him. A good man will find sufficient cause for mourning and weeping; for whether he considereth himself, or pondereth concerning his neighbour, he knoweth that no man liveth here without tribulation, and the more thoroughly he considereth himself, the more thoroughly he grieveth. Grounds for just grief and inward compunction there are in our sins and vices, wherein we lie so entangled that we are but seldom able to contemplate heavenly things.
108	1	I.108	108	Si frequentius de morte tua, quam de longitudine vitæ tua cogitares, non dubium, quin ferventius te emendares. Si etiam futuras Inferni, sivi Pergatorii, poenas cordialiter perpenderes, credo quod libenter dolorem et laborem sustineres, et nihil rigoris formidares. Sed quia ista ad cor non transeunt, et blandimenta adhuc amamus, ideo frigidi et valde pigri remanemus. Sæpe est inopia spiritus unde tam leviter conqueritur corpus miserum. Ora igitur humiliter ad Dominum ut det tibi compunctionis spiritum; et dic cum Propheta,Ciba me Domine pane lacrymarum et potum da mihi in lacrymis in mensura.	If thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy life should be, thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to improve. And if thou didst seriously consider the future pains of hell, I believe thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain and fear not discipline. But because these things reach not the heart, and we still love pleasant things, therefore we remain cold and miserably indifferent.
109	1	I.109	109	De conditione humanæ miseriæ.	XXII On the contemplation of human misery
110	1	I.110	110	Miser es ubicumque fueris, et quocumque te verteris, nisi ad Deum te convertas. Quid turbaris quia non succedit tibi sicut vis et desideras? Quis est qui habeat omnia secundum suam voluntatem? Nec ego, nec tu, nec aliquis hominum super terram. Nemo est in mundo sine aliqua tribulatione, vel angustia, quivis Rex, vel Papa. Quis est, qui melius habet? Utique qui pro Deo aliquid pati valet.	Thou art miserable wheresoever thou art, and whithersoever thou turnest, unless thou turn thee to God. Why art thou disquieted because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and desires? Who is he that hath everything according to his will? Neither I, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth. There is no man in the world free from trouble or anguish, though he were King or Pope. Who is he who hath the happiest lot? Even he who is strong to suffer somewhat for God.
111	1	I.111	111	Dicunt multi imbecilles et infirmi, Ecce quam bonam vitam ille homo habet, quam dives et quam magnus, quam potens et excelsus. Sed attende ad cælestia bona, et videbis quod omnia ista temporalia nulla sunt, sed magis incerta, et valde gravantia, quia nunquam sine solicitudine, et timore possidentur. Non est hominis felicitas habere temporalia ad abundantiam, et sufficit ei mediocritas. Vere miseria est vivere super terram. Quanto homo voluerit esse spiritualior, tanto præfens vita sit ei amarior, quia sentit melius, videt clarius humanæ corruptionis affectus. Nam comedere, bibere, vigilare, dormire, quiescere laborare et cæteris necessitatibus naturæ subjacere vere magna miseria est, et afflictio homini devoto, qui libenter esset absolutus et liber ab omni peccato.	There are many foolish and unstable men who say, “See what a prosperous life that man hath, how rich and how great he is, how powerful, how exalted.” But lift up thine eyes to the good things of heaven, and thou shalt see that all these worldly things are nothing, they are utterly uncertain, yea, they are wearisome, because they are never possessed without care and fear. The happiness of man lieth not in the abundance of temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth him. Our life upon the earth is verily wretchedness. The more a man desireth to be spiritual, the more bitter doth the present life become to him; because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of human corruption. For to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to rest, to labour, and to be subject to the other necessities of nature, is truly a great wretchedness and affliction to a devout man, who would fain be released and free from all sin.
112	1	I.112	112	Valde enim gravatur interior homo necessitatibus ocrporalibus in hoc mundo. Unde Propheta devote rogat quatenus ab istis liber esse valeat, dicens,De necessitatibus meis erue me, Domine.Sed væ non cognoscentibus suam miseriam et corruptibilem vitam. Nam in tantum quidam hanc amplectuntur, licet etiam vix necessaria laborando aut mendicando habeant, ut si possent hic semper vivere, de regno Dei nihil curarent.	For the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of the body in this world. Wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth to be freed from them, saying, Deliver me from my necessities, O Lord.(1) But woe to those who know not their own misery, and yet greater woe to those who love this miserable and corruptible life. For to such a degree do some cling to it (even though by labouring or begging they scarce procure what is necessary for subsistence) that if they might live here always, they would care nothing for the Kingdom of God.
113	1	I.113	113	O insani, et infideles corde, qui tam profunde in terris jacent, ut nihil nisi carnalia sapiant. Sed miseri adhuc in fine sentient graviter, quam vile, et nihilum erat, quod amaverunt. Sancti autem Dei, et omnes devoti amici Christi non attenderunt, quæ carni placuerunt, nec quæ in hoc tempore floruerunt. Sed tota spes eorum, et intentio ad ætena bona anhelabat. Ferebatur totum desiderium eorum ad mansura et invisibilia, ne amore visibilium traherentur ad infima.	Oh foolish and faithless of heart, who lie buried so deep in worldly things, that they relish nothing save the things of the flesh! Miserable ones! they will too sadly find out at the last, how vile and worthless was that which they loved. The saints of God and all loyal friends of Christ held as nothing the things which pleased the flesh, or those which flourished in this life, but their whole hope and affection aspired to the things which are above. Their whole desire was borne upwards to everlasting and invisible things, lest they should be drawn downwards by the love of things visible.
114	1	I.114	114	Noli frater amittere confidentiam proficiendi ad spiritualia. Adhuc enim habes tempus et horam, quare vis procrastinare propositum tuum? Surge, et in instanti incipe, et dic: Nunc est tempus faciendi, nunc tempus pugnandi est, nunc tempus aptum est emendandi. Quando male habes et tribularis, tunc tempus promerendi. Oportet te transire per ignem et aquam, antequam venia ad refrigerium, nisi tibi vim feceris, vitium non superabis. Quamdiu istud fragile corpus gerimus, sine peccato esse non possumus nec sine tædio et dolore vivere. Libenter haberemus ab omni miseria quietem, sed quia per peccatum perdidimus innocentiam, amisimus etiam veram beatitudinem. Ideo oportet nos tenere patientiam, et Dei exspectare misericordiam,donec transeat iniquitashæc, et mortalitas abforbeatur a vita.	Lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things spiritual. There is yet time, the hour is not past. Why wilt thou put off thy resolution? Arise, begin this very moment, and say, “Now is the time to do: now is the time to fight, now is the proper time for amendment.” When thou art ill at ease and troubled, then is the time when thou art nearest unto blessing. Thou must go through fire and water that God may bring thee into a wealthy place. Unless thou put force upon thyself, thou wilt not conquer thy faults. So long as we carry about with us this frail body, we cannot be without sin, we cannot live without weariness and trouble. Gladly would we have rest from all misery; but because through sin we have lost innocence, we have lost also the true happiness. Therefore must we be patient, and wait for the mercy of God, until this tyranny be overpast, and this mortality be swallowed up of life.
115	1	I.115	115	O quanta fragilitas humana, quæ semper prona est ad vitia. Hodie confiteris peccata tua, et cras iterum perpetras confessa. Nunc proponis cavere, et post horam ita agis, quasi nihil proposuisses. Merito ergo nosmetipsos humiliare possumus, nec unquam aliquid magni de nobis sentire, quia tam fragiles et instabiles sumus. Cito etiam potest perdi per negligentiam, quod multo labore vix tandem acquisitum est per gratiam.	O how great is the frailty of man, which is ever prone to evil! To-day thou confessest thy sins, and to-morrow thou committest again the sins thou didst confess. Now dost thou resolve to avoid a fault, and within an hour thou behavest thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all. Good cause have we therefore to humble ourselves, and never to think highly of ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and unstable. And quickly may that be lost by our negligence, which by much labour was hardly attained through grace.
116	1	I.116	116	Quid fiet de nobis adhuc in fine, qui tepescimus tam mane. Væ nobis si sic volumus declinare ad quietem, quasi jam pax sit et securitas, cum necdum appareat vestigium sanctitatis veræ in nostra conversatione. Bene opus esset quod adhuc institueremus, tanquam boni novitii, ad mores optimos, si forte spes esset de futurea emendatione, et majori spirituali profectu.	What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are lukewarm and idle? Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though it were a time of peace and security, while as yet no sign appeareth in our life of true holiness. Rather had we need that we might begin yet afresh, like good novices, to be instructed unto good living, if haply there might be hope of some future amendment and greater spiritual increase.
117	1	I.117	117	De meditatione mortis.	XXIII Of meditation upon death
118	1	I.118	118	Valde cito erit tecum hoc factum: vide aliter quomodo te habeas. Hodie homo est, et cras non comparet. Cum autem sublatus fuerit ab oculis, etiam cito transit a mente. O hebetudo, et duritia cordis humani, quod solum præsentia meditatur, et futura non magis prævidet. Sic te in omni facto et cogitatu deberes tenere, quasi statim esses moriturus. Si bonam conscientiam haberes, non multum mortem timeres. Melius esset peccata cavere quam mortem fugure. Si hodie non es paratus, quomodo cras eris? Cras est dies incerta, et quid scis si crastinum habebis?	Very quickly will there be an end of thee here; take heed therefore how it will be with thee in another world. To-day man is, and to-morrow he will be seen no more. And being removed out of sight, quickly also he is out of mind. O the dulness and hardness of man’s heart, which thinketh only of the present, and looketh not forward to the future. Thou oughtest in every deed and thought so to order thyself, as if thou wert to die this day. If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear death. It were better for thee to watch against sin, than to fly from death. If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt thou be ready to-morrow? To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow?
119	1	I.119	119	Quid prodest diu vivere, quando parum emendamur? Ha, longa vita non semper emendat, sed sæpe culpam magis auget. Utinam per unam diem bene essemus conversati in hoc mundo. Multi annos computant conversionis, sed sæpe parvus est fructus emendationis. Si formidolosum est mori, forsitan periculosius erit vivere diu. Beatus qui horam mortis suæ semper ante oculos habet, et ad moriendum quotidie se disponit. Si vidisti aliquem mori, cogita quia tu per eandem viam transibis.	What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little? Ah! long life doth not always amend, but often the more increaseth guilt. Oh that we might spend a single day in this world as it ought to be spent! Many there are who reckon the years since they were converted, and yet oftentimes how little is the fruit thereof. If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long. Happy is the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and daily prepareth himself to die. If thou hast ever seen one die, consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road.
120	1	I.120	120	Cum mane fuerit, puta te ad vesperum non perventurum. Vespere autem facto, mane non audeas tibi polliceri. Semper ergo paratus esto, et taliter vive, ut nunquam imparatum te mors inveniant. Multi subito improvisi moriuntur. Namhora, qua non putatur, Filius hominis veniet.Quando hora illa extrema venerit, multum aliter sentire incipies de tota vita tua præterita et valde dolebis, quia tam negligens, et remissus fuisti.	When it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see the evening, and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the morrow. Always be thou prepared, and so live that death may never find thee unprepared. Many die suddenly and unexpectedly. For at such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh. When that last hour shall come, thou wilt begin to think very differently of thy whole life past, and wilt mourn bitterly that thou hast been so negligent and slothful.
121	1	I.121	121	Quam felix et prudens qui talis nunc nititur esse in vita, qualis optat inveniri in morte. Dabit namque magnam fiduciam moriendi perfectus contemptus mundi, fervens desiderium in virtutibus proficiendi, amor disciplinæ, labor poenitentiæ, promptitudo, obedientiæ, abnegatio sui, et supportatio cujuslibet adversitatis pro amore Christi. Multa bona potes operari dum sanus es, sed infirmatus nescio quid poteris. Pauci ex infirmitate emendantur; sic et qui multum peregrinantur, raro sanctificantur.	Happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he would fain be found in death! For a perfect contempt of the world, a fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of discipline, the painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey, denial of self, submission to any adversity for love of Christ; these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy death. Whilst thou art in health thou hast many opportunities of good works; but when thou art in sickness I know not how much thou wilt be able to do. Few are made better by infirmity: even as they who wander much abroad seldom become holy.
122	1	I.122	122	Noli confidere super amicos et proximos, nec in futuris salutem tuam differas, quia citius obliviscentur tui homines, quam existimas. Melius est nunc tempestive providere et aliquid boni præmittere, quam super aliorum auxilio sperare. Si non es pro te ipso sollicitus modo, quis erit sollicitus pro te in futuro. Nunc tempus est valde prætiosum, sed proh dolor, quod hoc inutilius expendis, in quo promereri vales, unde æternaliter vivas. Veniet quando unam diem seu horam pro emendatione desiderabis, et nescio, an impetrabis.	Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of thy salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than thou thinkest. It is better for thee now to provide in time, and to send some good before thee, than to trust to the help of others. If thou art not anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest thou, will be anxious for thee afterwards? Now the time is most precious. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. But alas! that thou spendest not well this time, wherein thou mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee everlastingly. The hour will come when thou shalt desire one day, yea, one hour, for amendment of life, and I know not whether thou shalt obtain.
123	1	I.123	123	Eia, charissime, de quanto periculo te poteris liberare, de quam magno timore eripere, si modo semper timoratus fueris, et de morte suspectus! Stude nunc taliter vivere, ut in hora moris valeas potius gaudere, quam timere. Disce nunc mori mundo, ut tunc incipias vivere cum Christo. Disce nunc omnia contemnere, ut tunc possis libere ad Christum pergere. Castiga nunc corpus tuum per poenitentiam, ut tunc valeas certam habere confidentiam.	Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free thyself, from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live in fear, and in expectation of death! Strive now to live in such wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than fear. Learn now to die to the world, so shalt thou begin to live with Christ. Learn now to contemn all earthly things, and then mayest thou freely go unto Christ. Keep under thy body by penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure confidence.
124	1	I.124	124	Ha stulte, quid cogitas te diu victurum, cum nullum diem habeas securum? Quam multi decepti sunt et insperati de corpore extracti! Quoties audisti a dicentibus, quia ille gladio cecidit, ille submersus est, ille ab alto ruens cervicem fregit, ille manducando obriguit, ille ludendo finem fecit, alius igne, alius ferro, alius peste, alius latrocinio interiit: et sic omnium finis mors est, et vita hominum tanquam umbra cito pertransit.	Ah, foolish one! why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long, when thou art not sure of a single day? How many have been deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body! How many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword, another was drowned, another falling from on high broke his neck, another died at the table, another whilst at play! One died by fire, another by the sword, another by the pestilence, another by the robber. Thus cometh death to all, and the life of men swiftly passeth away like a shadow.
125	1	I.125	125	Quis memorabitur tui post mortem, et qui orabit pro te? Age, age nunc charissime quidquid pro te agere potes, quia nescis quando morieris. Nescis etiam, quid tibi post mortem sequatur. Dum tempus habes, congrega divitias immortales. Præter salutem tuam nihil cogites. Solum quæ Dei sunt, cures.Fac nunc tibi amicosvenerando Sanctos, et actus imitando,ut cum defeceris in hac vita, illi te recipiant in æterna tabernacula.	Who will remember thee after thy death? And who will entreat for thee? Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou canst. For thou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall happen unto thee after death. While thou hast time, lay up for thyself undying riches. Think of nought but of thy salvation; care only for the things of God. Make to thyself friends, by venerating the saints of God and walking in their steps, that when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting habitations.
126	1	I.126	126	Serva te tanquam peregrinum et hospitem super terram, ad quem nihil spectat de mundi negociis. Serva cor liberum, et ad Deum sursum erectum, quia non habes hic manentem civitatem. Illuc gemitus et preces quotidianas cum lacrymis dirige, ut spiritus tuus mereatur post mortem ad Dominum feliciter transire.	Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to whom the things of the world appertain not. Keep thine heart free, and lifted up towards God, for here have we no continuing city. To Him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears, that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death unto its Lord.
127	1	I.127	127	De judicio et poenis peccatorum.	XXIV Of the judgment and punishment of the wicked
128	1	I.128	128	In omnibus rebus respice finem, et qualiter ante districtum judicem stabis, cui nihil est occultum, qui muneribus non placatur, nec escusationes recipit, sed quod justum est, judicabit. O miserrime et insipiens, quid respondebis Deo, omniamala tua scienti, qui interdum times vultum hominis irati? Ut quid non prævides tibi in judicii die? Quando nemo poterit per alium excusari vel defendi, sed unusquisque sufficiens onus suum portabit sisi ipsi. Nunc labor tuus est fructuosus, fletus acceptabilies, gemitus exaudibilis, dolor satisfactorius et purgativus.	In all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not bribed with gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge righteous judgment. O most miserable and foolish sinner, who art sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man, what wilt thou answer to God, who knoweth all thy misdeeds? Why dost thou not provide for thyself against the day of judgment, when no man shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another, but each one shall bear his burden himself alone? Now doth thy labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to thy soul.
129	1	I.129	129	Habet magnum et salubre purgatorium homo patiens, qui suscipiens injurias, plus dolet de alterius malitia, quam de sua injuria, qui pro contrariantibus sibi libenter orat, et ex corde culpas indulget; qui veniam ab aliis petere non retardat, qui facilius miseretur quam irascitur, qui sibi ipsi violentiam frequenter facit, et carnem suam omnino spiritui subjugare conatur. Melius est modo purgare peccata, et vitia resecare, quam in futuro purganda reservare. Vere nos ipsos decipimus per inordinatum amorem, quem ad carnem habemus.	Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of purifying his soul. When suffering injuries he grieveth more for the other’s malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth heartily for those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them from his heart; when he is not slow to ask pardon from others; when he is swifter to pity than to anger; when he frequently denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to the spirit. Better is it now to purify the soul from sin, than to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter. Truly we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards the flesh.
130	1	I.130	130	Quid aliud ille ignis devorat, nisi peccata tua? Quanto amplius nunc tibi ipsi parcis, et carnem sequeris, postea lues tanto durius, et majorem materiam comburendi reservas. In quibus homo peccavit, in illis gravius punietur. Ibi acidiosi ardentibus stimulis purgentur, et gulosi ingenti fame ac siti cruciabuntur. Ibi luxuriosi et voluptatum amatores ardenti pice et foetido sulphure perfundentur. Et sicut furiosi canes, præ dolore invidiosi ululabunt.	What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins? The more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy shall thy punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up for the burning. For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he be the more heavily punished. There shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning goads, and the gluttons be tormented with intolerable hunger and thirst. There shall the luxurious and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for very grief.
131	1	I.131	131	Nullum vitium erit, quod suum proprium cruciatum non habeat. Ibi superbi omni confusione replebuntur, et avari miserrima egestate arctabuntur. Ibi erit una hora gravior in poena, quam hic centum anni in amarissima poenitentia. Ibi nulla requies, nulla consolatio damnatis. Hic tamen interdum cessatur a laboribus atque amicorum fruitur solatiis. Esto modo sollicitus, et dolens pro peccatis tuis, ut in die judicii sis securus propetenus cum beatis.Tuncenimjusti stabunt in magna constantia adversus eos, qui se angustiaveruntet depresserunt. Tunc stabit ad judicandum qui modo se subjicit humiliter judiciis hominum. Tunc magnam fiduciam pauper et humlis habebit, et pavebit undique superbus.	No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter confusion, and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable poverty. An hour’s pain there shall be more grievous than a hundred years here of the bitterest penitence. No quiet shall be there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends. Be thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed. For then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his labours. Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men. Then shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the proud is taken with fear on every side.
132	1	I.132	132	Tunc videbitur sapiens in hoc mundo fuisse, qui pro Christo didicit stultus esse et despectus. Tunc placebit omnis tribulatio patienter perpessaet omnis iniquitas oppilabit os suum.Tunc gaudebit omnis devotus et merebit omnis religiosus. Tunc plus exultabit caro afflicta, quam si semper in deliciis fuisset nutrita. Tunc splendebit habitus vilis, et obtenebrescet vestis subtilis. Tunc plus laudabitur pauperculum domicilium, quam deauratum palatium. Tunc plus juvabit constans pacientia, quam omnis mundi potentia. Tunc amplius exaltabitur simplex obedientia, quam omnis sæcularis astutia.	Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world who learned to be a fool and despised for Christ. Then shall all tribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the ungodly shall be stopped. Then shall every godly man rejoice, and every profane man shall mourn. Then the afflicted flesh shall more rejoice than if it had been alway nourished in delights. Then the humble garment shall put on beauty, and the precious robe shall hide itself as vile. Then the little poor cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace. Then enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the world. Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than all worldly wisdom.
133	1	I.133	133	Tunc plus lætificabit pura et simplex conscientia et bona quam docta philosophia. Tunc plus ponderabit contemptus divitiarum, quam totus thesaurus terrigenarum. Tunc magis consolaberis super devota oratione, quam super delicata comestione. Tunc potius gaudebis de fervato silentio, quam de longa fabulatione. Tunc plus valebunt sancta sancta opera, quam multa pulchra verba. Tunc plus valebit stricta vita et ardus poenitntia, quam omnis delectatio terrena. Disce nunc in modico pati, ut tunc a gravioribus valeas liberari. Hic primo proba quid possis pati postea. Si nunc tam parum non vales sustinere, quomodo poteris æterna tormenta sufferre? Si modo modica passio te tam impatientem efficit, tunc gehenna quid facietur? Ecce vere non potes modo duo gaudia habere, delectari hic in mundo, es postea regnare cum Christo.	Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than learned philosophy. Then contempt of riches shall have more weight than all the treasure of the children of this world. Then shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in having fared sumptuously. Then thou wilt rather rejoice in having kept silence than in having made long speech. Then holy deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words. Then a strict life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all earthly delight. Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings. Prove first here, what thou art able to endure hereafter. If now thou art able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal torments? If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient, what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not able to have two Paradises, to take thy fill or delight here in this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter.
134	1	I.134	134	Si usque in hodiernum diem semper in honoribus et voluptatibus vixisses, quid totum tibi profuisset, si jam in instanti mori contingeret? Omnia ergo vanitas, præter amare Deum, et illi foli servire. Qui enim Deum ex toto corde amat, nec mortem, nec supplicium, nec judcium, nec infernum metuit, quia perfectus amor securum ad Deum accessum facit. Quem adhuc peccare delectat, non mirum, si mortem, judicium timeat. Bonum tamen est ut, si necdum amor a malo te revocat, saltem timor gehenæ te coerceat. Qui vero timorem Dei postponit, diu stare in bono non valebit, sed diaboli laqueos citius incurret.	If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to thee in an instant? All therefore is vanity, save to love God and to serve Him only. For he who loveth God with all his heart feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell, because perfect love giveth sure access to God. But he who still delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and judgment. Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should hold thee back. But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of the devil.
135	1	I.135	135	De ferventi emendatione totius vitæ.	XXV Of the zealous amendment of our whole life
136	1	I.136	136	Esto vigilans et diligens in Dei fervitio, et cogita frequenter ad quid venisti, et cur sæculum reliquisti. Nonne ut Deo viveres, et spiritualis fieres? Igitur ad profectum ferveas, quia mercedem laborum tuorum in brevi recipies. Nec erit tunc amplius timor aut dolor in finibus tuis. Modicum nunc laborabis, et magnam requiem, imo perpetuam lætitiam, invenies. Si tu permanseris fidelis et fervidus in agendo, Deus procul dubio erit fidelis, et locuples in retribuendo. Spem bonam retinere debes, quod ad palmam pervenies, sed securitatem capere non oportet ne torpeas, aut elatus fias.	Be thou watchful and diligent in God’s service, and bethink thee often why thou hast renounced the world. Was it not that thou mightest live to God and become a spiritual man? Be zealous, therefore, for thy spiritual profit, for thou shalt receive shortly the reward of thy labours, and neither fear nor sorrow shall come any more into thy borders. Now shalt thou labour a little, and thou shalt find great rest, yea everlasting joy. If thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in labour, doubt not that God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding thee. It is thy duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory, but thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or lifted up.
137	1	I.137	137	Cum enim quidam anxius inter metum et spem frequenter fluctuaret, et quadam vice moerore confectus in ecclesia ante quoddam altare se in oratione prostravisset, hæc intra se resolvit dicens: O, si scirem, quod adhuc perserveratus essem; statimque audivit divinum intus responsum. Quid, si hoc scires, quid facere velles? Fac nunc quod facere velles, et bene securus eris. Moxque consolatus et confortatus divinæ se commisit voluntati, et cessavit anxia fluctuatio. Noluitque curiose se investigare, ut sciret quæ sibi essent futura, sed magis studuit inquirere quæ esset voluntas Dei beneplacens et perfecta ad omne opus inchoandum et perficiendum.	A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed about between hope and fear, and being on a certain day overwhelmed with grief, cast himself down in prayer before the altar in a church, and meditated within himself, saying, “Oh! if I but knew that I should still persevere,” and presently heard within him a voice from God, “And if thou didst know it, what wouldst thou do? Do now what thou wouldst do then, and thou shalt be very secure.” And straightway being comforted and strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will of God, for the beginning and perfecting of every good work.
138	1	I.138	138	Spera in Domino et fac bonitatem,ait Propheta,et inhabita terram, et pasceris in divitiis ejus.Unum est quod multos a profectu et ferventi emendatione retrahit: horror difficultatis seu labor certaminis. Illi maxime præ aliis in virtutibus proficiunt, qui ea quæ sibi magis gravia et contraria sunt vincere nituntur. Nam ibi homo plus proficit, et gratiam meretur ampliorem, ubi magis se ipsum vincit, et in spiritu mortificat.	Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell in the land and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches. One thing there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent amendment, even the dread of difficulty, or the labour of the conflict. Nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth most and meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and mortifieth himself in spirit.
139	1	I.139	139	Sed non omnes habent æque multum ad vincendum et moriendum. Diligens autem æmulator valentior erit ad proficiendum, etiamsi plures habeat passiones, quam alius bene morigeratus, minus tamen fervens ad virtutes. Duo specialiter ad magnam emendationem juvant, videlicet subtrahere se violenter ad quod natura vitiose inclinatur, et ferventer instare pro bono, quo amplius quis indiget. Illa etiam magis studeas cavere et vincere quæ tibi in aliis frequentius displicent.	But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to mortify, yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit, although he have stronger passions, than another who is more temperate of disposition, but is withal less fervent in the pursuit of virtue. Two things specially avail unto improvement in holiness, namely firmness to withdraw ourselves from the sin to which by nature we are most inclined, and earnest zeal for that good in which we are most lacking. And strive also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which displease thee most frequently in others.
140	1	I.140	140	Ubique profectum tuum capies ut si bona exempla videas vel audias, de imitandis accendaris. Si quid autem reprehensibile confideraveris, cave ne idem facias, aut si aliquando fecisti, citius emendare te studeas. Sicut oculus tuus alios confiderat, sic iterum ab aliis notaris. Quam jucundum et dulce est videre fervidos et devotos Fratres bene morigeratos et disciiplinatos. Quam triste est et grave videre inordinate ambulantes, qui ea ad quæ vocati sunt non exercent. Quam nocivum est negligere vocationis suæ propositum, et ad non comissia sensum inclinare.	Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them, but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed that thou do not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it, strive quickly to amend thyself. As thine eye observeth others, so again are the eyes of others upon thee. How sweet and pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of good discipline; and how sad is it and grievous to see them walking disorderly, not practising the duties to which they are called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none of their business.
141	1	I.141	141	Memor esto arrepti propositi, et imaginem crucifixi tibi propone. Bene verecundari potes inspecta vita Jesu Christi, quia necdum magis illi te conformare studuisti, licet diu in via Dei fuisti. Religiosus qui se intente et devote in sanctissima vita et passione Domini exercet, omnia utilia et necessaria sibi abundanter ibi inveniet. Nec opus est ut extra Jesum aliquid melius quærat. O, si Jesus crucifixus in cor nostrum veniret, quam cito et sufficienter docti essemus. Religiosus fervidus bene omnia portat et capit, quæ illi jubentur.	Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified. Truly oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of Jesus Christ, because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform thyself more unto Him, though thou hast been a long time in the way of God. A religious man who exercises himself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall find there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything better beyond Jesus. Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts, how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we need to know!
142	1	I.142	142	Religiosus negligens et tepidus habet tribulationem super tribulationem et ex omni parte patitur angustiam, quia interiori consolatione caret, et exteriorem quærere prohibetur. Religiosus extra disciplinam vivens gravi patet ruinæ. Qui laxiora quærit et remissiora, semper in angustiis erit, quia unum aut reliquum displicebit sibi.	He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that are laid upon him. He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble upon trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he is without inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that which is outward. He who is living without discipline is exposed to grievous ruin. He who seeketh easier and lighter discipline shall always be in distress, because one thing or another will give him displeasure.
143	1	I.143	143	Quomodo faciunt tam multi alii Religiosi qui satis arctati sunt sub disciplina claustrali, rare execunt, abstracte vivunt, pauperrime comedunt, grosse vestiuntur, multum laborant, parum loquuntur, diu vigilant, mature surgunt, et orationes prolongant, frequenter legunt et se in omni disciplina custodiunt. Attende Cartusienses et Benedictinos, et Cistercienses ac diversæ religionis Monachos et Moniales qualiter omni nocte ad psallendum Deo surgunt. Et ideo turpe esset, ut tu debeas in tam sancto opere dormitare et pigritare, ubi tanta multitudo Religiosorum incipit Deo jubilare.	How do so many others, Religious men, live—who are strictly confined under monastic discipline, seldom go forth, dwell apart, eat in utmost poverty, clothe themselves coarsely, labour much, speak little, keep long vigils, rise early, prolong their prayers, read frequently, and keep themselves under strict rule in all things? Consider the Carthusians, the Benedictines, the Cistercians, and monks and nuns of many orders, how they rise each night to sing praises unto God. And shall it not be a shame unto thee to sleep and grow slothful in so holy a work, while such a multitude of Religious lift up their voices to rejoice in God?
144	1	I.144	144	O, si nihil aliud faciendum incumberet, nisi Dominum Deum nostrum tot corde et ore laudare. O, si nunquam indigeres comedere, nec bibere, nec dormire, sed semper posses Deum laudare, et solummodo spiritualibus studiis vacare, tunc multo felicior esses, quam modo carni ex qualicumque necessitate serviens. Utinam non essent istæ necessitates, sed solummodo spirituales animæ refectiones, quas heu satis raro degustamus.	O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God with our whole heart and voice! Oh! if thou never hadst need to eat or drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou be far happier than now, when for so many necessities thou must serve the flesh. O! that these necessities were not, but only the spiritual refreshments of the soul, which alas we taste too seldom.
145	1	I.145	145	Quando homo ad hoc pervenit, quod de nulla creatura consolationem quærit, tunc ei Deus primo perfecte sapere incipit, tunc etiam bene contentus de omni eventu rerum erit, tunc nec pro magno lætabitur, nec pro modico contristabitur, sed ponit se integre, et fiducialiter in Deo, qui est ei omnia in omnibus, cui nihil utique parit, nec moritur, sed omnia ei vivunt, et ad nutum incunctanter deserviunt.	When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto him. Then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for little, but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust unto God, who is all in all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor dieth, but all things live to Him and obey His every word without delay.
146	1	I.146	146	Memento semper finis, et quia perditum non redit tempus, sine sollicitudine, et diligentia nunquam acquires virtutes. Si incipis tepescere, incipis male habere. Si autem dederis te ad fervorem, invenies magnam pacem, et senties leviorem laborem propter Dei gratiam et virtutis amorem. Homo fervidus et diligens ad omnia est paratus. Major labor est resistere vitiis et passionibus, quam corporalibus insudare laboribus. Qui parvos non devitat defectus, paulatim labitur ad majora. Gaudebis semper de vespere, si diem expendes fructuose. Vigila semper te ipsum et quidquid de aliis sit non negligas te ipsum. Tantum proficies, quantum tibi ipsi vim intuleris. Amen.	Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost returneth not. Without care and diligence thou shalt never get virtue. If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill with thee, but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find much peace, and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the grace of God and the love of virtue. A zealous and diligent man is ready for all things. It is greater labour to resist sins and passions than to toil in bodily labours. He who shunneth not small faults falleth little by little into greater. At eventide thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably. Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more violence thou dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit. Amen.
147	2	II.1	1	Liber Secundus: Admonitiones ad interna trahentes.	THE SECOND BOOK: ADMONITIONS CONCERNING THE INNER LIFE
148	2	II.2	2	I. Incipit liber de interna conversationes.	I Of the inward life
149	2	II.3	3	Regnum Dei intra vos est,dicit Dominus. Converte te ex toto corde tuo ad Dominum, et relinque hunc miserum mundum, et inveniet anima tua requiem. Disce exteriora contemnere et ad interiora te dare, et videbis regnum Dei intra te venire.Est enim regnum Dei pax et gaudium in Spiritu Sanctoquod non datur impiis. Veniet ad te Christus ostendens tibi consolatinem suam, si dignam illi ab intus paraveris mansionem. Omnis gloria ejus et decor ab intra est, et ibi complacet sibi. Frequens illi visitatio cum homine interno, dulcis sermocinatio, grata consolatio, multa pax, familiaritas stupenda nimis.	The kingdom of God is within you, saith the Lord. Turn thee with all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable world, and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul. Learn to despise outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee. For the kingdom of God is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and it is not given to the wicked. Christ will come to thee, and show thee His consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him within thee. All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it pleaseth Him to dwell. He often visiteth the inward man and holdeth with him sweet discourse, giving him soothing consolation, much peace, friendship exceeding wonderful.
150	2	II.4	4	Eya anima fidelis, præpara huic sponso cor tuum, quatenus ad te venire et in te habitare dignetur. Sic enim dicit:Si quis diligit me, sermonem meum servabit, et ad eum veniemus, et mansionem apud eum faciemus.Da ergo Christo locum et cæteris omnibus nega introitum. Cum Christum habueris, dives es, et sufficit tibi. Ipse erit provisor tuus, et fidelis procurator in omnibus, ut non fit opus in hominibus sparare. Homines enim cito mutantur, et deficiunt velociter, Christus autem manet in æternum, et adstat usque in finem firmiter.	Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom that he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for so He saith, if any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. Give, therefore, place to Christ and refuse entrance to all others. When thou hast Christ, thou art rich, and hast sufficient. He shall be thy provider and faithful watchman in all things, so that thou hast no need to trust in men, for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ remaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end.
151	2	II.5	5	Non est magna fiducia ponenda in homine fragili et mortali, etiamsi utilis fit et dilectus, neque tristitia multa capienda ex hoc, si interdum adversetur et contradicat. Qui hodie tecum sunt, cras contrariari possunt. Et e converso sæpe ut aura vertuntur. Pone fiduciam tuam totam in Domino; et sit ipse timor tuus, et amor tuus. Ipse pro te respondebit, et faciet bene sicut melius fuerit. Nonhabes hic manentem civitatem, et ubicumque fueris, extraneus es et peregrinus, nec requiem aliquando habebis, nisi Christo intime fueris unitus.	There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal man, even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict us. They who are on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against thee, and often are they turned round like the wind. Put thy whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear and thy love, He will answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee what is best. Here hast thou no continuing city, and wheresoever thou art, thou art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have rest unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee.
152	2	II.6	6	Quid hic circumspicis, cum iste non sit locus tuæ requietonis? In cælestibus debet esse habitatio tua et sicut in transitu cuncta sunt aspicienda. Transeunt omnia, et tu cum eis pariter. Vide, ut non hæreas, ne capiaris, et pereas. Apud Altissimum sit cogitatio tua, et deprecatio tua ad Christum sine intermissione dirigatur. Si nescis alta speculari et cælestia, requiesce in passione Christi, et in sacris vulneribus ejus libenter habita. Si enim ad vulnera et speciosa stigmata Jesu devote confugis, magnam in tribulatione senties consolationem, nec multum curabis hominum despectiones faciliterque verba detrahentium perferes.	Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this is not the place of thy rest? In heaven ought thy habitation to be, and all earthly things should be looked upon as it were in the passing by. All things pass away and thou equally with them. Look that thou cleave not to them lest thou be taken with them and perish. Let thy contemplation be on the Most High, and let thy supplication be directed unto Christ without ceasing. If thou canst not behold high and heavenly things, rest thou in the passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred wounds. For if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the precious marks of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great comfort in tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much, and thou wilt easily bear their unkind words.
153	2	II.7	7	Jesus Christus Dominus fuit etiam in mundo ab hominibus despectus, et in maxima necessitate, a notis et amicis inter opprobria derelictus. Dominus Jesus pati voluit et despici, et tu audes de aliquo conqueri? Christus habuit adversarios et oblocutores, et tu vis omnes habere amicos, et benefactores? Ubi coronabitur patentia tua, si nihil adversitatis occurrit. Si nihil contrarium vis pati, quomodo eris amicus Christi? Sustine cum Christo et pro Christo, si vis regare cum Christo.	Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and rejected of men, and in His greatest necessity was left by His acquaintance and friends to bear these reproaches. Christ was willing to suffer and be despised, and darest thou complain of any? Christ had adversaries and gainsayers, and dost thou wish to have all men thy friends and benefactors? Whence shall thy patience attain her crown if no adversity befall thee? If thou art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt thou be the friend of Christ? Sustain thyself with Christ and for Christ if thou wilt reign with Christ.
154	2	II.8	8	Si semel perfecte introisses in interiora Jesu, et modicum de ardenti amore ejus sapuisses, tunc de proprio commodo, vel incommodo nihil curares, sed magis de opprobrio illato gauderes, quia amor Jesu facit hominem se ipsum contemnere. Amator Jesu et verus internus, et liber ab affectionibus inordinatis, potest se ad Deum libere convertere, et elevare se supra se ipsum in spiritu ac fruitive quiescere.	If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst tasted yea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou care nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience, but wouldst rather rejoice at trouble brought upon thee, because the love of Jesus maketh a man to despise himself. He who loveth Jesus, and is inwardly true and free from inordinate affections, is able to turn himself readily unto God, and to rise above himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful peace.
155	2	II.9	9	Cui sapiunt omnia prout sunt non ut dicuntur, aut æstimantur, hic vere sapiens est, et doctus a Deo magis, quam ab hominibus. Qui ab intra scit ambulare et modicum res ab extra ponderare, non reqirit loca, nec tempora expectat ad habenda devota exercitia. Homo internus cito se recolligit, et nunquam se totum ad exteriora effundit. Non illi obest labor exterior, aut occupatio ad tempus necessaria. Sed sicut res eveniunt, sic se illis accommodat. Qui intus bene dispositus est et ordinatus, non curat mirabiles et perversos hominum gestus. Tantum homo impeditur, et distrahitur, quantum sibi res attrahit.	He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of men. He who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little value upon outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for seasons, for holding his intercourse with God. The inward man quickly recollecteth himself, because he is never entirely given up to outward things. No outward labour and no necessary occupations stand in his way, but as events fall out, so doth he fit himself to them. He who is rightly disposed and ordered within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of men. A man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by outward things.
156	2	II.10	10	Si recte tibi esses, et bene purgatus esses, omnia tibi in bonum cederent, et profectum. Ideo multa tibi sæpe displicent et sæpe conturbant, quia adhuc non es perfecte tibi mortuus, nec segregatus ab omnibus terrenis. Nihil sic maculat et implicat cor hominis, sicut impurus amor in creaturis. Si renuis consolari exterius, poteris speculari cælestia, et frequenter interius jubilare.	If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil, all things would work together for thy good and profiting. For this cause do many things displease thee and often trouble thee, that thou art not yet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated from all earthly things. Nothing so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as impure love towards created things. If thou rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to contemplate heavenly things and frequently to be joyful inwardly.
157	2	II.11	11	De submissione, Prælati regimine.	II Of lowly submission
158	2	II.12	12	Non magni pendas qui pro te vel contra te fit, sed hoc age, et cura, ut Deus tecum sit in omni re quam facis. Habeas conscientiam bonam, et Deus bene te defensabit. Quem enim adjuvare voluerit, nullius perversitas nocere poterit. Si tu sci tacere et pati, videbis proculdubio auxilium Domini. Ipse novit tempus, et modum liberandi te, et idea debes te illi resignare. Dei est adjuvare, et ab omni confusione liberare. sæpe valde prodest ad majorem humilitatem conservandam, quod defectus nostros alii sciunt, et redarguunt.	Make no great account who is for thee or against thee, but mind only the present duty and take care that God be with thee in whatsoever thou doest. Have a good conscience and God will defend thee, for he whom God will help no man’s perverseness shall be able to hurt. If thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the help of the Lord. He knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee, therefore must thou resign thyself to Him. To God it belongeth to help and to deliver from all confusion. Oftentimes it is very profitable for keeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our faults.
159	2	II.13	13	Quando pro defectibus suis se humiliat, tunc faciliter alios placat, et leviter satisfacit sibi irascentibus. Humilem Deus protegit, et liberat. Humilem diligit, et consolatur. Humili homini se inclinat. Humili largitur gratiam plenam et magnam. Et post suam depressionem levat ad gloriam. Humili sua secreta revelat, et ad se dulciter trahit, et invitat. Humilis accepta contumelia et confusione satis bene est in pace, quia stat in Deo, et non in mundo. Non reputes te aliquid profecisse, nisi omnibus te inferiorem esse sentias.	When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered against him. God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He loveth and comforteth the humble man, to the humble man He inclineth Himself, on the humble He bestoweth great grace, and when he is cast down He raiseth him to glory: to the humble He revealeth His secrets, and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to Himself. The humble man having received reproach, is yet in sufficient peace, because he resteth on God and not on the world. Reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel thyself to be inferior to all.
160	2	II.14	14	De bono pacifico homine.	HAPTER III Of the good, peaceable man
161	2	II.15	15	Pone te primus in pace, et tunc alios poteris pacificare. Homo pacificus plus prodest, quam bene doctus. Homo passionatus etiam bonus in malum trahit, et faciliter malum credit. Bonus homo pacificus omnia ad bonum convertit. Qui bene in pace est, de nullo suspicatur. Qui autem male contentus est, et commotus, variis suspicionibus agitatur, nec ipse quiescit, nec alios quiescere permittit. Dicit sæpe quod sibi magis facere expediret, et negligit, quod ipse facere tenetur. Habe ergo primum zelum super te ipsum, tunc zelare poteris etiam juste proximum tuum.	First keep thyself in peace, and then shalt thou be able to be a peacemaker towards others. A peaceable man doth more good than a well-learned. A passionate man turneth even good into evil and easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all things into good. He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to be quiet. He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth what it were more expedient for him to do. He considereth to what duties others are bound, and neglecteth those to which he is bound himself. Therefore be zealous first over thyself, and then mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour.
162	2	II.16	16	Tu bene facta scis excusare, et tolerare, et aliorum non vis accipere excusationes. Justus esses, si te accusares, et fratrem tuum excusares. Si portari vis, porta alium. Vide quam longe es adhuc a vera charitate, et humilitate, quæ nuli novit indignarei vel irasci, nisi tantum sibi ipsi. Non est magnum cum bonis, et mansuetis conversari. Hoc enim omnibus naturaliter placet, et unusquisque libenter pacem habet, et secum sentientes magis diligit. Sed cum duris, et perversis aut indisciplinatis aut nobis contrariantibus pacifice posse vivere, magna gratia est, et laudabile nimis virileque factum.	Thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds, but thou wilt not accept the excuses of others. It would be more just to accuse thyself and excuse thy brother. If thou wilt that others bear with thee, bear thou with others. Behold how far thou art as yet from the true charity and humility which knows not how to be angry or indignant against any save self alone. It is no great thing to mingle with the good and the meek, for this is naturally pleasing to all, and every one of us willingly enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who think with us: but to be able to live peaceably with the hard and perverse, or with the disorderly, or those who oppose us, this is a great grace and a thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man.
163	2	II.17	17	Sed sunt qui se ipsos in pace tenent, et cum aliis etiam pacem habent. Et sunt qui nec pacem habent, nec alios in pace dimittunt. Aliis sunt graves, sed sibi sunt semper graviores. Et sunt qui se ipsos in pace retinent, et ad pacem alios reducere student. Et tamen tota pax nostra in hac misera vita potius in humili sufferentia ponenda est, quam in non sentiendo contraria? Qui melius scit pati, pacem tenebit maiorem. Iste est victor fui, et dominus mundi, amicus Christi, et hæres cæli.	There are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also with others, and there are who neither have peace nor suffer others to have peace; they are troublesome to others, but always more troublesome to themselves. And there are who hold themselves in peace, and study to bring others unto peace; nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life lieth in humble suffering rather than in not feeling adversities. He who best knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace; that man is conqueror of himself and lord of the world, the friend of Christ, and the inheritor of heaven.
164	2	II.18	18	De pura mente et simplici intentione.	IV Of a pure mind and simple intention
165	2	II.19	19	Duabus alis homo sublevatur a terrenis, scilicet simplicitate et puritate. Simplicitas debet esse in intentione, puritas in affectione. Simplicitas intendit deum, puritas apprehendit et gustat. Nulla actio te impediet, si liber intus ab omni inordinato affectu fueris. Si nihil aliud quam Dei beneplacitum, et proximi utilitatem intendis et quæris, interna libertate frueris. Si rectum cor tuum esset, tunc omnis creatura speculum vitæ, et liber sanctæ doctrinæ esset. Non est creatura tam parva et vilis quæ bonitatem Dei non repræsentet.	By two wings is man lifted above earthly things, even by simplicity and purity. Simplicity ought to be in the intention, purity in the affection. Simplicity reacheth towards God, purity apprehendeth Him and tasteth Him. No good action will be distasteful to thee if thou be free within from inordinate affection. If thou reachest after and seekest, nothing but the will of God and the benefit of thy neighbour, thou wilt entirely enjoy inward liberty. If thine heart were right, then should every creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine. There is no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the goodness of God.
166	2	II.20	20	Si tu esses intus bonus, et purus, tunc omnia sine impedimento, et caperes bene. Cor purum penetrat cælum, et infernum. Qualis unusquisque est intus, taliter iudicat exterius. Si est gaudium in mundo, hoc utique possidet cordis puri homo. Et si est alicubi tribulatio et angustia, hoc melius novit mala conscientia. Sicut ferrum missum in ignem amittit rubiginem et totum candens efficitur, sic homo ad Deum integre se convertens, a torpore exuitur, et in novum hominem transmutatur.	If thou wert good and pure within, then wouldst thou look upon all things without hurt and understand them aright. A pure heart seeth the very depths of heaven and hell. Such as each one is inwardly, so judgeth he outwardly. If there is any joy in the world surely the man of pure heart possesseth it, and if there is anywhere tribulation and anguish, the evil conscience knoweth it best. As iron cast into the fire loseth rust and is made altogether glowing, so the man who turneth himself altogether unto God is freed from slothfulness and changed into a new man.
167	2	II.21	21	Quando homo incipit tepescere, tunc parvum metuit laborem, et externam accipit consolationem. Sed quando perfecte incipit se vincere, et viriliter in via Dei ambulare, tunc minus ea reputat, quæ sibi prius gravia esse sentiebat.	When a man beginneth to grow lukewarm, then he feareth a little labour, and willingly accepteth outward consolation; but when he beginneth perfectly to conquer himself and to walk manfully in the way of God, then he counteth as nothing those things which aforetime seemed to be so grievous unto him.
168	2	II.22	22	De propria consideratione.	V Of self-esteem
169	2	II.23	23	Non possumus nobis ipsis nimis credere, quia sæpe gratia nobis deest, modicum lumen est in nobis, et hoc cito per negligentiam amittimus. Sæpe etiam non advertimus, quod tam cæci intus sumus. Sæpe male agimus, et peius excusamus. Et passione interdum movemur, et zelum putamus. Parva in aliis reprehendimus, et nostra maiora pertransimus. Satis cito persentimus et ponderamus quid ab aliis sustinemus; sed quantum alii de nobis sustinent, non advertimus. Qui bene et recte sua ponderaret, non esset quid de alio graviter iudicaret.	We cannot place too little confidence in ourselves, because grace and understanding are often lacking to us. Little light is there within us, and what we have we quickly lose by negligence. Oftentimes we perceive not how great is our inward blindness. We often do ill and excuse it worse. Sometimes we are moved by passion and count it zeal; we blame little faults in others and pass over great faults in ourselves. Quickly enough we feel and reckon up what we bear at the hands of others, but we reflect not how much others are bearing from us. He who would weigh well and rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of another.
170	2	II.24	24	Internus homo sui ipsius curam omnibus curis anteponit: et qui sibi ipsi diligenter intendit, faciliter de aliis tacet. Nunquam eris internus et devotus, nisi de aliis silueris et ad te ipsum specialiter respexeris. Si tibi ipsi et Deo totaliter intendis, modicum te movebit, quod foris percipis. Ubi es, quando tibi ipsi præsens non es? Et quando omnia percurristi, quid te neglecto profecisti? Si debes habere pacem et unionem veram, oportet, quod totum adhuc postponas et te solum præ oculis habeas.	The spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all cares; and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth silence concerning others. Thou wilt never be spiritually minded and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men’s matters and take full heed to thyself. If thou think wholly upon thyself and upon God, what thou seest out of doors shall move thee little. Where art thou when thou art not present to thyself? and when thou hast overrun all things, what hath it profited thee, thyself being neglected? If thou wouldst have peace and true unity, thou must put aside all other things, and gaze only upon thyself.
171	2	II.25	25	Multum proinde proficies, si te seriatum ab omni temporali cura conserves. Valde deficies, si aliquid temporale reputaveris. Nihil altum, nihil magnum, nihil gratum, nihil acceptum tibi sit, nisi pure Deus, aut de Deo sit. Totum vanum exstima, quidquid consolationis occurrit de aliqua creatura. Amans Deum anima sub Deo contemnit, despicit universa. Solus Deus æternus et immensus, implens omnia, solatium est animæ et vera mentis lætitia.	Then thou shalt make great progress if thou keep thyself free from all temporal care. Thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou set a value upon any worldly thing. Let nothing be great, nothing high, nothing pleasing, nothing acceptable unto thee, save God Himself or the things of God. Reckon as altogether vain whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature. The soul that loveth God looketh not to anything that is beneath God. God alone is eternal and incomprehensible, filling all things, the solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart.
172	2	II.26	26	De lætitia bonæ conscientiæ	VI Of the joy of a good conscience
173	2	II.27	27	Gloria bonis hominibus testimonium bonæ conscientiæ. Habe bonam conscientiam et semper habebis lætitiam. Bona conscientia valde multa potest portare, et valde læta est inter adversa. Mala conscientia semper timida, et inquieta. Suaviter requiesces, si te cor tuum non reprehenderit. Noli lætari, nisi cum benefeceris. Mali nunquam habent veram lætitiam, nec internam sentiunt pacem, quianon est pax impiis, dicit Dominus.Et si dixerint: in pace sumus, non venient super nos mala; et quis nobis nocere audebit? non credas eis, quoniam repente exsurget ira Dei, et in nihilum redigentur actus eorum, et cogitationes eorum peribunt.	The testimony of a good conscience is the glory of a good man. Have a good conscience and thou shalt ever have joy. A good conscience is able to bear exceeding much, and is exceeding joyful in the midst of adversities; an evil conscience is ever fearful and unquiet. Thou shalt rest sweetly if thy heart condemn thee not. Never rejoice unless when thou hast done well. The wicked have never true joy, nor feel internal peace, for there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. And if they say “we are in peace, there shall no harm happen unto us, and who shall dare to do us hurt?” believe them not, for suddenly shall the wrath of God rise up against them, and their deeds shall be brought to nought, and their thoughts shall perish.
174	2	II.28	28	Gloriari in tribulationibusnon est grave amanti, Sic enim gloriari estin cruce Domini gloriari.Brevis gloria quæ ab hominibus datur et accipitur. Mundi gloriam semper comitatur tristitia. Bonorum gloria in conscientiis eorum, et non in ore hominum. Justorum lætitia de Deo et in Deo est, et gaudium eorum de veritate. Qui veram et æternam gloriam desiderat, temporalem non curat. Et qui temporalem quærit gloriam, aut non ex animo contemnit, minus amare convincitur cælestem. Magnam habet cordis tranquillitatem, qui nec laudes curat, nec vituperia.	To glory in tribulation is not grievous to him who loveth; for such glorying is glorying in the Cross of Christ. Brief is the glory which is given and received of men. Sadness always goeth hand in hand with the glory of the world. The glory of the good is in their conscience, and not in the report of men. The joy of the upright is from God and in God, and their joy is in the truth. He who desireth true and eternal glory careth not for that which is temporal; and he who seeketh temporal glory, or who despiseth it from his heart, is proved to bear little love for that which is heavenly. He who careth for neither praises nor reproaches hath great tranquillity of heart.
175	2	II.29	29	Facile erit contentus et pacatus, cuius conscientia munda est. Non es sanctior, si laudaris, nec vilior, si vituperaris. Quod es hoc es, nec melior dici vales, quam Deo teste sis, si attendis quid apud te sis intus, non curabis quid de te loquantur homines foris. Homo videt in facie, Deus autem in corde. Homo confiderat actus, Deus pensat intentionem. Bene semper agere, et modicum de se tenere humilis animæ indicium est. Nolle consolari ab aliqua creatura magnæ puritatis, et internæ fiduciæ indicium est.	He will easily be contented and filled with peace, whose conscience is pure. Thou art none the holier if thou art praised, nor the viler if thou art reproached. Thou art what thou art; and thou canst not be better than God pronounceth thee to be. If thou considerest well what thou art inwardly, thou wilt not care what men will say to thee. Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart:man looketh on the deed, but God considereth the intent. It is the token of a humble spirit always to do well, and to set little by oneself. Not to look for consolation from any created thing is a sign of great purity and inward faithfulness.
176	2	II.30	30	Qui nullum extrinsecus pro se testimonium quærit, liquet quod Deo se totaliter commisit.Non enim, qui se ipsum commendat, ille probatus est,ait beatus Paulus,sed quem Deus commendat.Ambulare cum Deo intus, nec aliqua affectione teneri foris, status est interni hominis.	He that seeketh no outward witness on his own behalf, showeth plainly that he hath committed himself wholly to God. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, as St. Paul saith, but whom the Lord commendeth. To walk inwardly with God, and not to be held by any outer affections, is the state of a spiritual man.
177	2	II.31	31	De amore Jesu super omnia.	VII Of loving Jesus above all things
178	2	II.32	32	Beatus qui intelligit quid sit amare Jesum, et contemnere se ipsum propeter Deum? Oportet dilectum propter dilectum relinquere, quia Jesus vult solus super omnia amari. Dilectio creaturæ fallax et instabilis, dilectio Jesu felix et perseverabilis. Qui adhæret creaturæ, cadet cum labili, qui amplectitur Jesum, firmabitur in Eum. Illum dilige, et amicum tene tibi, qui omnibus recedentibus te non relinquet, nec patietur in fine perire. Ab omnibus oportet aliquando te separari, sive velis, sive nolis.	Blessed is he who understandeth what it is to love Jesus, and to despise himself for Jesus’ sake. He must give up all that he loveth for his Beloved, for Jesus will be loved alone above all things. The love of created things is deceiving and unstable, but the love of Jesus is faithful and lasting. He who cleaveth to created things will fall with their slipperiness; but he who embraceth Jesus will stand upright for ever. Love Him and hold Him for thy friend, for He will not forsake thee when all depart from thee, nor will he suffer thee to perish at the last. Thou must one day be separated from all, whether thou wilt or wilt not.
179	2	II.33	33	Tene te apud Jesum vivens et moriens et illius fedelitati te committe, qui omnibus deficientibus solus potestte adjuvare. Dilectus tuus talis est naturæ, ut alienum non velit admittere, sed solus vult cor tuum habere, et tanquam rex in proprio throno sedere. Si scires te ab omni creatura evacuare, Jesus libenter tecum habitaret. Pene totum perditum invenies, quidquid extra Jesum in hominibus posueris. Non confidas, nec innitaris super calamum ventosum, quiaomnis caro fœnum, et omnis gloria ejus et flosfœni cadet.	Cleave thou to Jesus in life and death, and commit thyself unto His faithfulness, who, when all men fail thee, is alone able to help thee. Thy Beloved is such, by nature, that He will suffer no rival, but alone will possess thy heart, and as a king will sit upon His own throne. If thou wouldst learn to put away from thee every created thing, Jesus would freely take up His abode with thee. Thou wilt find all trust little better than lost which thou hast placed in men, and not in Jesus. Trust not nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind, because all flesh is grass, and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the field.
180	2	II.34	34	Cito deciperis, si ad externam hominum apparentiam tantum aspexeris. Si autem tuum in aliis quæris solatium, et lucrum, sæpe senties detrimentum. Si quæris in omnibus Jesum, invenies utique Jesum. Si autem quæris te ipsum, invenies etiam te ipsum, sed ad tuam perniciem. Plus enim homo nocivior est sibi, si Jesum non quærit, quam totus mundus, et omnes sui adversarii.	Thou wilt be quickly deceived if thou lookest only upon the outward appearance of men, for if thou seekest thy comfort and profit in others, thou shalt too often experience loss. If thou seekest Jesus in all things thou shalt verily find Jesus, but if thou seekest thyself thou shalt also find thyself, but to thine own hurt. For if a man seeketh not Jesus he is more hurtful to himself than all the world and all his adversaries.
181	2	II.35	35	De familiari amicitia Jesu.	VIII Of the intimate love of Jesus
182	2	II.36	36	Quando Jesus adest, totum bonum est, nec quicquam difficile videtur. Quando vero Jesus non adest, totum durum est. Si autuem Jesus unum verbum loquitur tantum, magna consolatio sentitur. Nonne ne Maria Magdalena statim surreit de loco, in quo flevit, quando Martha illi dixit,Magister adet et vocat te?Felix hora quando Jesus vocat te de lacrymis ad gaudium spiritus. Quam aridus et durus es sine Jesu. Quam insipiens et vanus, si cupis aliquid extra Jesum. Nonne hoc est majus damnum, quam si totum perderes mundum?	When Jesus is present all is well and nothing seemeth hard, but when Jesus is not present everything is hard. When Jesus speaketh not within, our comfort is nothing worth, but if Jesus speaketh but a single word great is the comfort we experience. Did not Mary Magdalene rise up quickly from the place where she wept when Martha said to her, The Master is come and calleth for thee? Happy hour when Jesus calleth thee from tears to the joy of the spirit! How dry and hard art thou without Jesus! How senseless and vain if thou desirest aught beyond Jesus! Is not this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world?
183	2	II.37	37	Quid habet mundus conferre sine Jesu? Esse sine Jesu est gravis infernus, et esse cum Jesu dulcis paradisus. Si fuerit tecum Jesus, invenit thesaurum bonus, immo bonum super omne bonum. Et qui perdidit Jesum, perdidit nimis multum et plus quam totum mundum. Pauperrimus est qui vivit sine Jesu, ditissimus est qui bene est cum Jesu.	What can the world profit thee without Jesus? To be without Jesus is the nethermost hell, and to be with Jesus is sweet paradise. If Jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee. He who findeth Jesus findeth a good treasure, yea, good above all good; and he who loseth Jesus loseth exceeding much, yea, more than the whole world. Most poor is he who liveth without Jesus, and most rich is he who is much with Jesus.
184	2	II.38	38	Magna ars est scire conversari cum Jesu, et scire Jesum tenere, magna prudentia. Esto humilis et pacificus, et erit tecum Jesus. Sis devotus et quietus, et permanebit tecum Jesus. Potes cito fugare Jesum, et gratiam ejus perdere, si volueris ad exteriora declinare. Et si illum effugaveris et perdideris, ad quem tunc fugies, et quem tunc quæres amicum? Sine amico non potes diu vivere. Et si Jesus non fuerit tibi præ omnibus amicus, eris nimis tristis, et desolatus. Fatue igitur agis, si in aliquo altero confidis et lætaris. Eligendum est magis habere totum mundum contrarium, quam Jesum offensum. Ex omnibus ergo charis sit Jesus dilectus specialis.	It is great skill to know how to live with Jesus, and to know how to hold Jesus is great wisdom. Be thou humble and peaceable and Jesus shall be with thee. Be godly and quiet, and Jesus will remain with thee. Thou canst quickly drive away Jesus and lose His favour if thou wilt turn away to the outer things. And if thou hast put Him to flight and lost Him, to whom wilt thou flee, and whom then wilt thou seek for a friend? Without a friend thou canst not live long, and if Jesus be not thy friend above all thou shalt be very sad and desolate. Madly therefore doest thou if thou trusteth or findest joy in any other. It is preferable to have the whole world against thee, than Jesus offended with thee. Therefore of all that are dear to thee, let Jesus be specially loved.
185	2	II.39	39	Diligantur homines propter Jesum, Jesus autem propter se ipsum. Solus Jesus Christus singulariter est amandus, qui bonus solus et fidelis invenitur præ omnibus amicis. Propter ipsum et in ipso tam amici quam inimici tibi sint chari et pro omnibus his exorandus est, ut omnes ipsum cognoscant et diligant. Nunquam cupias singulariter laudari et amari, quia hoc solius Dei est, qui similem sibi non habet. Nec velis quod aliquis in corde tuo tecum occupetur, neque tu cum alicujus occuperis amore. Sed sit Jesus in te, et in omni bono homine.	Let all be loved for Jesus’ sake, but Jesus for His own. Jesus Christ alone is to be specially loved, for He alone is found good and faithful above all friends. For His sake and in Him let both enemies and friends be dear to thee, and pray for them all that they may all know and love Him. Never desire to be specially praised or loved, because this belongeth to God alone, who hath none like unto Himself. Nor wish thou that any one set his heart on thee, nor do thou give thyself up to the love of any, but let Jesus be in thee and in every good man.
186	2	II.40	40	Esto purus, et liber intus, sine alicujus creaturæ implicamento. Oportet te esse nudum, et purum cor ad Jesum gerere, si vis vacare, etvidere, quam suavis est Dominus.Et revera ad hoc non pervenies, nisi gratia ejus fueris præventus, et introtractus, ut omnibus evacuatis et licentiatis, solus cum Deo uniaris. Quando enim gratia Dei venit ad hominem, tunc potens sit ad omnia. Et quando recedit, tunc pauper et infirmus erit, et quasi tantum ad flagella relictus. In his non debes dejici, nec desperare, sed ad voluntatem Dei æquanimiter stare, et cuncta supervenientia tibi ad laudem Jesu Christi perpeti. Quia post hiemem sequitur aestas, post nectem redit dies, et post tempestatem serenitas magna.	Be pure and free within thyself, and be not entangled by any created thing. Thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to God, if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the Lord is. And in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by His grace, thou wilt not attain to this, that having cast out and dismissed all else, thou alone art united to God. For when the grace of God cometh to a man, then he becometh able to do all things, and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and given up unto troubles. In these thou art not to be cast down nor to despair, but to rest with calm mind on the will of God, and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of Jesus Christ; for after winter cometh summer, after night returneth day, after the tempest a great calm.
187	2	II.41	41	De carentia omnis solatii.	IX Of the lack of all comfort
188	2	II.42	42	Non est grave humanum contemnere solatium, cum adest divinum. Magnum est, et valde magnum, tam humano quam divino posse carere solatio et pro amore Dei libenter exilium cordis velle sustinere et in nullo se ipsum quærere, nec ad proprium meritum respicere. Quid magis es, si hilaris si, et devotus adveniente gratia? Optabilis cunctis hæc hora. Satis suaviter equitat quem gratia Dei portat. Et quid mirum si onus non sentit, qui portatur ab Omnipotente, et ducitur a summo Ductore?	It is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is present. It is a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear the loss both of human and divine comfort; and for the love of God willingly to bear exile of heart, and in nought to seek oneself, nor to look to one’s own merit. What great matter is it, if thou be cheerful of heart and devout when favour cometh to thee? That is an hour wherein all rejoice. Pleasantly enough doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth. And what marvel, if he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty, and is led onwards by the Guide from on high?
189	2	II.43	43	Libenter aliquid habemus pro solatio, et homo difficulter exuitur a se ipso. Vicit sanctus Laurentius sæculum, cum Summo Sacerdote, quia omne, quod in mundo delectabile videbatur despexit, et Dei Summum Sacerdotem Sixtem, quem maxime diligebat, pro amore Christi etiam a se tolli clementer ferebat. Amore igitur Creatoris amorem hominis superavit, et pro humano solatio divinum beneplacitum magis elegit. Ita et tu aliquem necessarium, et dilectum amicum pro amore Dei disce relinquere. Nec graviter feras cum ab amico fueris derelictus, sciens quoniam oportet nos omnes tandem ab invicem separari.	We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is difficult for a man to be freed from himself. The holy martyr Laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly master, because he despised everything in the world which seemed to be pleasant; and for the love of Christ he calmly suffered even God’s chief priest, Sixtus, whom he dearly loved, to be taken from him. Thus by the love of the Creator he overcame the love of man, and instead of human comfort he chose rather God’s good pleasure. So also learn thou to resign any near and beloved friend for the love of God. Nor take it amiss when thou hast been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted from one another at last.
190	2	II.44	44	Multum et diu oportet hominem in se ipso certare, antequam discat se ipsum plene superare, et totum affectum suum plene in Deum trahere. Quando homo stat super se ipsum, facile labitur ad consolationes humanas. Sed verus Christi amator, et studiosus sectator virtutum non cadit super illas consolationes, nec quærit tales sensibiles dulcedines. Sed magis fortes tentationes et exercitationes, et pro Christo duros sustinere labores.	Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he learn altogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole affection towards God. When a man resteth upon himself, he easily slippeth away unto human comforts. But a true lover of Christ, and a diligent seeker after virtue, falleth not back upon those comforts, nor seeketh such sweetness as may be tasted and handled, but desireth rather hard exercises, and to undertake severe labours for Christ.
191	2	II.45	45	Cum igitur spiritualis consolatio a Deo datur, cum gratiarum actione accipe eam et Dei munus intellige esse, et non tuum meritum et noli extolli. Noli nimium gaudere nec inaniter præsumere, sed esto magis humilior ex dono, cautior quoque et timoratior in cunctis actibus tuis, quoniam transibit hora illa, et sequetur tentatio. Cum ablata fuerit consolatio, non statim desperes, sed cum humilitate, et patientia exspecta cælestem visitationem, quia potens est Deus ampliorem tibi redonare gratiam et consolationem. Istud non est novum, nec alienum viam Dei expertis, quia in magnis sanctis, et in antiquis prophetis suit sæpe alternationis modus.	When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it with giving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not thy desert. Be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly presume, but rather be more humble for the gift, more wary and more careful in all thy doings; for that hour will pass away, and temptation will follow. When comfort is taken from thee, do not straightway despair, but wait for the heavenly visitation with humility and patience, for God is able to give thee back greater favour and consolation. This is not new nor strange to those who have made trial of the way of God, for with the great saints and the ancient prophets there was often this manner of change.
192	2	II.46	46	Unde quidam præsente jam gratia dicebat:Ego dixi in abundantia mea non movebor in æternum.Absente autem gratia quid in se fuerit expertus, adjungit dicens:Avertisti faciem tuam a me, et factus sum conturbatus.Inter hæc tamen nequaquam desperat, sed instantius Dominum rogat, et dicit:Ad te, Domine, clamabo, et ad Deum meum deprocabor.Denique orationis suæ fructum reportat, et se exauditum testatur dicens:Audivit Dominus et misertus est mei, Dominus factus est adjutor meus.Sed in quo?Convertisti,inquit,planctum meum in gaudium mihi, et circumdedisti me lætitia.Et si sic actum est cum magnis Sanctis, non est desperandum nobis informis et pauperibus, si interdum in frigiditate, et interdum in fervore sumus. Quoniam spiritus venit, et recedit, secundum suæ voluntatis beneplacitum. Unde beatus Job ait:Visitas eum iluculo, et subito probas illum.	Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with him, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved, but he goeth on to say what he felt within himself when the favour departed: Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled. In spite whereof he in no wise despaireth, but the more instantly entreateth God, and saith, Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and will pray unto my God; and then he receiveth the fruit of his prayer, and testifieth how he hath been heard, saying, The Lord heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my helper. But wherein? Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. If it was thus with the great saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to despair if we are sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the cold, for the Spirit cometh and goeth according to the good pleasure of His will. Wherefore holy Job saith, Thou dost visit him in the morning, and suddenly Thou dost prove him.
193	2	II.47	47	Super quid igitur sperare possum, aut in quo confidere debeo, nisi in sola magna misericordia Domini, et in sola spe gratiæ cælestis? Sive enim adsint homines boni sive devoti fratres, et amici fideles, sive libri sancti, vel tractatus pulchri, sive dulces cantus et hymni, omnia hæc modicum juvant, et modicum sapiunt, quando sum defertus a gratia, et in propria paupertate relictus. Tunc non est melius remedium quam patientia, et abnegatio mei in voluntate Dei.	Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only in the great mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace? For whether good men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends, whether holy books or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns and songs, all these help but little, and have but little savour when I am deserted by God’s favour and left to mine own poverty. There is no better remedy, then, than patience and denial of self, and an abiding in the will of God.
194	2	II.48	48	Nunquam inveni aliquem Religiosum, qui non habuerit interdum gratiæ subtractionem, aut non senserit fervoris diminutionem. Nullus Sanctus fuit tam alte raptus, vel illuminatus, qui prius vel postea non fuerit tentatus. Non enim alta Dei contemplatione dignus est, qui pro Deo non est exercitatus aliqua tribulatione. Solet enim sequentis consolationis tribulatio præcedens esse signum. Nam tentationibus probatis cælestis promittitur consolatio.Qui vicerit,inquit,dabo ei edere de ligno vitæ.	I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of fervour. No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so enlightened, but that sooner or later he was tempted. For he is not worthy of the great vision of God, who, for God’s sake, hath not been exercised by some temptation. For temptation is wont to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow, and heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by temptation. As it is written, To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life.
195	2	II.49	49	Datur etiam consolatio divina, ut homo fortior sit ad sustinendum adversa. Sequitur etiam tentatio, ne se elevet de bono. Non dormit diabolus, nec caro adhuc mortua est. Ideo non cesses te præparare ad certamen, quia a dextris et a sinistris sunt hostes qui nunquam quiescunt.	Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear adversities. And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up because of the benefit. The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not yet dead; therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto the battle, for enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left, and they are never at rest.
196	2	II.50	50	De gratitudine progratia Dei.	X Of gratitude for the Grace of God
197	2	II.51	51	Quid quæris quietem, cum natus sis ad laborem, ad patientiam magis quam ad consolationem, et ad crucem portandam magis quam ad lætitiam? Quis etiam sæcularium non libenter consoltionem et lætitiam spiritualiem acciperet, si semper obtinere posset? Excedunt enim spirituales consolationes omnes mundi delicias et carnis voluptates. Nam omnes deliciæ mundanæ aut turpes, aut vanæ sunt. Spirituales vero deliciæ solæ sunt jucundæ et honestæ ex virtutibus progenitæ, et a Deo puris infusæ mentibus. Sed istis divnis consolationibus nemo semper pro suo affectu frui valet, quia tempus tentationis non diu cessat.	Why seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour? Prepare thyself for patience more than for comforts, and for bearing the cross more than for joy. For who among the men of this world would not gladly receive consolation and spiritual joy if he might always have it? For spiritual comforts exceed all the delights of the world, and all the pleasures of the flesh. For all worldly delights are either empty or unclean, whilst spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable, the offspring of virtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds. But no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own will, because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long.
198	2	II.52	52	Multum contrariatur supernæ visitationi salsa libertas animi, et magna confidentia sui. Deus benefacit consolatinis gratiam dando, sed homo male facit non statim Deo cum gratiarum actione retribuendo. Et ideo non possunt in nobis dona gratiæ fluere, quia ingrati sumus auctori, nec totum refundimus fontali origini. Semper enim debetur gratia digne gratias agenti sive referenti. Auferetur ab elato, quod dari solet humili.	Great is the difference between a visitation from above and false liberty of spirit and great confidence in self. God doeth well in giving us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not immediately giving God thanks thereof. And thus the gifts of grace are not able to flow unto us, because we are ungrateful to the Author of them, and return them not wholly to the Fountain whence they flow. For grace ever becometh the portion of him who is grateful and that is taken away from the proud, which is wont to be given to the humble.
199	2	II.53	53	Nolo consolationem quæ mihi auferat compunctionem, nec affecto contemplationem, quæ ducit in elationem. Non enim omne altum sanctum, nec omne desiderium purum, nec omne dulce bonum, nec omne carum gratum Deo. Libenter accepto gratiam unde humilior, et timoratior inveniar atque ad relinquendum me paratior fiam. Doctus dono gratiæ, et eruditus subtractionis verbere non sibi audebit, quidquam boni attribuere, sed potius se pauperem, et nudum confitebitur.Da Deo quidquid Dei est,et tibi adscribe, quod tuum est. Hoc est Deo gratias pro gratia tribue, tibi autem soli culpam, et dignam pœnam pro culpa deberi sentias.	I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction, I love no contemplation which leadeth to pride. For all that is high is not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every desire is not pure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing unto God. Willingly do I accept that grace whereby I am made humbler and more wary and more ready to renounce myself. He who is made learned by the gift of grace and taught wisdom by the stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not dare to claim any good thing for himself, but will rather confess that he is poor and needy. Give unto God the thing which is God’s, and ascribe to thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God for His grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy punishment is deserved for thy fault.
200	2	II.54	54	Pone te semper ad infimum, et dabitur tibi summum. Nam summum non stat sine infimo. Summi Sancti apud Deum minimi sunt apud se, et quanto gloriosiores, tanto in se humiliores; pleni veritate et gloria cælesti, non vanæ gloriæ cupidi et in Deo fundati et confirmati, nullo modo possunt esse elati. Et qui Deo totum adscribunt quidquid boni acceperunt, gloriam ab invicem non quærunt. Sedgloriam quæ a Deo estvolunt, et Deum quærunt in se, et in omnibus Sanctis laudari super omnia cupiunt, et semper in ipsum tendunt.	Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be given the highest place. For the highest cannot be without the lowest. For the highest saints of God are least in their own sight, and the more glorious they are, so much the lowlier are they in themselves; full of grace and heavenly glory, they are not desirous of vain-glory; resting on God and strong in His might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise. And they who ascribe unto God all the good which they have received, “seek not glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God only,” and they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all His Saints above all things, and they are always striving for this very thing.
201	2	II.55	55	Esto igitur gratus in minimo, et eris dignus majora accipere. Sit tibi minimum pro maximo et contemtibile pro speciali dono. Si dignitas datoris inspicitur, nullum datum parvum aut minus vile videbitur. Non enim parvum est quod a summo Deo donatur, etiam si pœnas et verbera donaverit, gratum esse debet, quia semper pro salute nostra facit quidquid nobis advenire permittit. Qui gratiam Dei retinere desiderat, sit gratus pro gratia Dei data, patiens pro sublata, oret ut reddatur, cautus sit et humilis ne amittat.	Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt be worthy to receive greater. Let the least be unto thee even as the greatest, and let that which is of little account be unto thee as a special gift. If the majesty of the Giver be considered, nothing that is given shall seem small and of no worth, for that is not a small thing which is given by the Most High God. Yea, though He gave punishment and stripes, we ought to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit whatever He suffereth to come upon us. He who seeketh to retain the favour of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and patient in respect of that which is taken away. Let him pray that it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it not.
202	2	II.56	56	De paucitate amatorum crucis.	XI Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus
203	2	II.57	57	Habet autem Jesus multos amatores sui regnis cælestis, sed paucos bajulatores suæ crucis. Plures invenit socios mensæ sed paucos abstinentiæ. Omnes volunt cum Christo gaudere, sed pauci volunt aliquid pro ipso sustinere. Multi sequuntur Jesum usque as fractionem panis, sed pauci ad bibendum calicem passionis. Multi miracula ejus venerantur, sed pauci ignominias crucis sequuntur. Multi Jesum diligunt, quamdiu adversa non contingunt. Multi illum laudant et benedicunt, quamdiu consolationes aliquas ab ipso recipiunt. Si autem Jesus se abscondiderit, et modicum eos reliquerit, aut in querimoniam aut in dejectionem nimiam cadunt.	Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus Jesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of His Cross. He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of tribulation. He findeth many companions of His table, but few of His fasting. All desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to undergo anything for His sake. Many follow Jesus that they may eat of His loaves, but few that they may drink of the cup of His passion. Many are astonished at His Miracles, few follow after the shame of His Cross. Many love Jesus so long as no adversities happen to them. Many praise Him and bless Him, so long as they receive any comforts from Him. But if Jesus hide Himself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either into complaining or into too great dejection of mind.
204	2	II.58	58	Qui autem Jesum propter Jesum, et non propter aliquam suam consolationem propriam diligunt, ipsum in tribulatione, et in angustia cordis, sicut in summa consolatione diligunt, et benedicunt. Et si eis consolationem nunquam dare vellet, ipsum tamen laudarent, et semper gratias agere vellent.	But they who love Jesus for Jesus’ sake, and not for any consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and anguish of heart as in the highest consolation. And if He should never give them consolation, nevertheless they would always praise Him and always give Him thanks.
205	2	II.59	59	O, quantum potest amor Jesu purus, nullo propio commodo vel amore permixtus. Nonne omnes mercenarii sunt dicendi, qui consolationes semper quærunt? Nonne amatores sui magis quam Jesu probantur qui sua commoda vel lucra semper meditantur? Ubi invenitur talis, qui velit servire Deo gratis?	Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any gain or love of self! Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations? Do they not prove themselves lovers of self more than of Christ who are always seeking their own gain and advantage? Where shall be found one who is willing to serve God altogether for nought?
206	2	II.60	60	Raro invenitur tam spiritualis aliquis qui omnibus sit nudatus. Nam verum spiritu pauperem ab omni creatura nudum quis inveniet?Procul et de omnibus finibus pretium ejus.Si dederit homo omnem substantiam suam, adhuc nihil est. Et si fecerit pœnitentiam magnam, adhuc exiguum est. Et si apprehenderit omnem scientiam, adhuc longe est. Et si habuerit virtutem magnam, et devotionem nimis ardentem, adhuc sibi multum deest. Unum scilicet, quod sibi summe necessarium est. Quid illud? Ut omnibus relictis se relinquat, et a se totaliter exeat, nihilque de privato amore retineat. Cum omnia fecerit quæ facienda noverit, nihil se fecisse sentiat.	Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all selfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit and free of all created things? “His value is from afar, yea from the ends of the earth.” A man may give away all his goods, yet that is nothing; and if he do many deeds of penitence, yet that is a small thing; and though he understand all knowledge, yet that is afar off; and if he have great virtue and zealous devotion, yet much is lacking unto him, yea, one thing which is the most necessary to him of all. What is it then? That having given up all things besides, he give up himself and go forth from himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and having done all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he feel that he hath done nothing.
207	2	II.61	61	Non grande ponderet quod grandis extimari possit, sed in veritate fervum inutilem se pronunciet. Sicut veritas ait:Cum feceritis omnia quæ nobis præcepta sunt, adhuc dicite, quia servi inutiles sumus.Tunc vero pauper, et nudus spiritu esse poterit, et cum Propheta dicere:Quia unicus et pauper sum ego.Nemo isto ditior, nemo tam liberior, nemo potentior eo, qui scit se et omnia relinquere et ad infimum se ponere.	Let him not reckon that much which might be much esteemed, but let him pronounce himself to be in truth an unprofitable servant, as the Truth Himself saith, When ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants. Then may he be truly poor and naked in spirit, and be able to say with the Prophet, As for me, I am poor and needy. Nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man stronger, no man freer. For he knoweth both how to give up himself and all things, and how to be lowly in his own eyes.
208	2	II.62	62	De regia via sanctae crucis.	XII Of the royal way of the Holy Cross
209	2	II.63	63	Durus hic multis videtur sermo.Abnego temet ipsum, tolle crucem tuam et sequere Jesum.Sed multo durius erit audire illud extremum verbum:Discedite a me, omnes maledicti, in ignem æternum.Qui enim modo libenter audiunt verbum crucis, et sequuntur, tunc non timebunt ab auditione æternæ damnationis. Hoc signum crucis erit in cælo, cum Dominus ad judicandum venerit. Tunc omnes servi crucis, qui se Crucifixo conformaverunt in vita, ad Christum accedent judicem cum magna fiducia.	That seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me. But it will be much harder to hear that last sentence, Depart from me, ye wicked, into eternal fire. For they who now willingly hear the word of the Cross and follow it, shall not then fear the hearing of eternal damnation. This sign of the Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord cometh to Judgment. Then all servants of the Cross, who in life have conformed themselves to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the Judge with great boldness.
210	2	II.64	64	Quid igitur times tollere crucem, per quam itur ad Regnum? In cruce salus. In cruce vita. In cruce protectio ab hostibus. In cruce robur mentis. In cruce gaudium spiritus. In cruce virtus summa. In cruce perfectio sanctitatis. Non est salus animae, nec spes æternæ vitæ, nisi in cruce. Tolle ergo crucem et sequere Jesum, et ibis in vitam æternam. Præcessit ille bajulans sibi crucem, et mortuus est pro te in cruce, ut tu etiam portes crucem, et mori affectes in cruce. Quia, si commortuus fueris in cruce, etiam cum illo pariter vives, et si socius fueris pœ, socius eris et gloriæ.	Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a kingdom? In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the Cross is protection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly sweetness, in the Cross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of the spirit, in the Cross the height of virtue, in the Cross perfection of holiness. There is no health of the soul, no hope of eternal life, save in the Cross. Take up therefore, thy cross and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal life. He went before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the Cross, that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be crucified upon it. For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also live with Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou shalt be also of His glory.
211	2	II.65	65	Ecce in cruce totum jacet, et non est alia via ad vitam, et ad veram et internam pacem, nisi via sanctæ crucis, et quotidianæ mortificationis. Ambula ubi vis, quære quodcumque volueris, et non invenies altiorem viam supra, nec securiorem infra, nisi viam sanctæ crucis. Dispone et ordina omnia secundum velle tuum et videre,et non invenies, nisi semper aliquid pati debere aut sponte aut invite et ita crucem semper invenies. Aut enim in corpore dolorem senties, aut in anima spiritus tribulationem sustinebis.	Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything lieth in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true inward peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily mortification. Go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt, and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below, than the way of the Holy Cross. Dispose and order all things according to thine own will and judgment, and thou shalt ever find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly, and thus thou shalt ever find thy cross. For thou shalt either feel pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul.
212	2	II.66	66	Interdum a Deo relinqueris, interdum a proximo exercitaberis, et quod amplius est sæpe tibimetipsi gravis eris. Nec tamen aliquo remedio vel solatio liberari seu alleviari poteris, sed donec Deus voluerit, oportet ut sustineas. Vult enim Deus ut tribulationem sine consolatione discas pati, et illi totaliter te subjicias et humilior ex tribulatione fias. Nemo ita cordialiter sentit passionem Christi, sicut is cui contigerit similia pati. Crux igitur semper parata est, et ubique te exspectat. Non potes effugere ubicumque cucurreris, quia ubicumque veneris, temetipsum tecum portas, et semper te ipsum invenies. Converte te supra, converte te infra, converte te extra et intra, et in his omnibus invenies crucem, et necese est te ubicumque tenere patientiam, si internam vis habere pacem et perpetuam promereri coronam.	Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be tried by thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be wearisome to thyself. And still thou canst not be delivered nor eased by any remedy or consolation, but must bear so long as God will. For God will have thee learn to suffer tribulation without consolation, and to submit thyself fully to it, and by tribulation be made more humble. No man understandeth the Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath had somewhat of the like suffering himself. The Cross therefore is always ready, and every where waiteth for thee. Thou canst not flee from it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou comest, thou bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find thyself. Turn thee above, turn thee below, turn thee without, turn thee within, and in them all thou shalt find the Cross; and needful is it that thou everywhere possess patience if thou wilt have internal peace and gain the everlasting crown.
213	2	II.67	67	Si libenter crucem portas, portabit te, et deducet te ad desideratum finem, ubi scilicet finis patiendi erit. Si invite portas, onus tibi facis, et te ipsum magis gravas, et tamen oportet ut sustineas. Si abjicis unam crucem, aliam proculdubio invenies, et forsitan graviorem.	If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will bring thee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall be the end of suffering; though it shall not be here. If thou bear it unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly increaseth thy load, and yet thou must bear it. If thou cast away one cross, without doubt thou shalt find another and perchance a heavier.
214	2	II.68	68	Credis tu evadere, quod nemo mortalium potuit præterire? Quis Sanctorum in mundo sine cruce et tribulatione fuit? Nec enim Dominus noster Jesus Christus una hora sine dolore passionis fuit, quamdiu vixit.OpertebatautemChristum pati, et resurgere a mortuis, et ita intrare in gloriam suam.Et quomodo tu aliam viam crucem quæris, quam hanc regiam, quæ est via sanctæ crucis.	Thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to avoid? Which of the saints in the world hath been without the cross and tribulation? For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was one hour without the anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived. It behooved, He said, Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and so enter into his glory. And how dost thou seek another way than this royal way, which is the way of the Holy Cross?
215	2	II.69	69	Tota vita Christi crux fuit, et martyrium, et tu tibi quæris reqiuem, et gaudium? Erras, erras si aliud quæris quam pati tribulationes, quia tota ista vita mortalis plena est miseriis, et circumsignata crucibus. Et quanto quis altius in spiritu profecerit, tanto gravioes cruces sæpe inveniet, quia exilii sui pœna magis ex amore crescit.	The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost thou seek for thyself rest and joy? Thou art wrong, thou art wrong, if thou seekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this whole mortal life is full of miseries, and set round with crosses. And the higher a man hath advanced in the spirit, the heavier crosses he will often find, because the sorrow of his banishment increaseth with the strength of his love.
216	2	II.70	70	Sed tamen iste sic multipliciter afflictus, non est sine lavamine consolationis, quia fructum magnum sibi sentit accrescere ex sufferentia suæ crucis. Nondum sponte illi se subjicit, omne onus tribulationis in fiduciam divinæ consolationis convertitur. Et quanto caro magis per tribulationem atteritur, tanto amplius spiritus per internam consolationem roboratur. Et nonnunquam in tantum confortatur ex affectu tribulationis, et adversitatis ob amorem conformitatis crucis Christi, ut non sine dolore, et tribulatione esse vellet, quoniam se tantum acceptiorem Deo reddit, quanto dura, et graviora plura pro eo ferre poterit. Non est istud virtus hominis, sed gratia Christi, quæ tanta potest, et agit in carne fragili, ut quod naturaliter semper abhorret et fugit, hoc fervore spiritus aggrediatur et diligat.	But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not without refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant fruit to be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross. For whilst he willingly submitteth himself to it, every burden of tribulation is turned into an assurance of divine comfort, and the more the flesh is wasted by affliction, the more is the spirit strengthened mightily by inward grace. And ofttimes so greatly is he comforted by the desire for tribulation and adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of Christ, that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more and the heavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake. This is not the virtue of man, but the grace of Christ which hath such power and energy in the weak flesh, that what it naturally hateth and fleeth from, this it draweth to and loveth through fervour of spirit.
217	2	II.71	71	Non est secundum hominem crucem portare, crucem amare, corpus castigare, et servituti subjicere, honores fugere, contumelias libenter sustinere, se ipsum despicere, et despici optare, adversa quæquæ cum damnis perpeti, et nihil prosperitatis in hoc mundo desiderare. Si ad te ipsum respicis, nihil hujusmodi ex te poteris. Sed si in Domino confidis, dabitur tibi fortitudo de cælo, et subjicientur ditioni tuæ mundus et caro, sed nec inimicum diabolum timebis, si fueris fide armatus, et cruce Jesu signatus.	It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the cross, to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to fly from honours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and desire to be despised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to desire no prosperity in this world. If thou lookest to thyself, thou wilt of thyself be able to do none of this; but if thou trustest in the Lord, endurance shall be given thee from heaven, and the world and the flesh shall be made subject to thy command. Yea, thou shalt not even fear thine adversary the devil, if thou be armed with faith and signed with the Cross of Christ.
218	2	II.72	72	Pone ergo te sicut fidelis et bonus servus Christi ad portandum viriliter crucem Domini tui pro te ex amore crucifixi. Præpara te ad toleranda multa adversa, et varia incommoda in hac misera vita, quia sic tecum erit ubicumque, et sic revera eum invenies ubicumque latueris. Oportet te ita esse, et non est remedium evadendi a tribulatione malorum, et dolore, quam ut te patiaris. Calicem Domini affectanter bibe, si amicus ejus esse, et partem cum eo habere desideras. Consolationes Deo committe, faciat ipse cum talibus sicut sibi magis placuerit. Tu vero pone te ad sustinendum tribulatones, et reputa eas maximas consolationes, quianon sunt condignæ passiones hujus temporis ad futuram gloriam, quæ revelabitur in nobis,promerendam, etiam si omnes solus posses sustinere.	Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of Christ, to the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out of love was crucified for thee. Prepare thyself for the bearing many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life; because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art, and so in very deed thou shalt find it, wherever thou hide thyself. This it must be; and there is no means of escaping from tribulation and sorrow, except to bear them patiently. Drink thou lovingly thy Lord’s cup if thou desirest to be His friend and to have thy lot with Him. Leave consolations to God, let Him do as seemeth best to Him concerning them. But do thou set thyself to endure tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us, nor would they be even if thou wert to endure them all.
219	2	II.73	73	Quando ad hoc veneris, quod tribulatio tibi dulcis erit et sapiet pro Christo, tunc bene tecum esse exstima, quia invenisti paradisum in terra. Quamdiu tibi pati grave est et fugere quæris, tamdiu male habebis, et sequentur te ubique tribulationes.	When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and pleasant to thee for Christ’s sake, then reckon that it is well with thee, because thou hast found paradise on earth. So long as it is hard to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long it will not be well with thee, and tribulations will follow thee everywhere.
220	2	II.74	74	Si ponis te ad quod esse debes, videlicet ad patiendum, et moriendum, fiet cito melius, et pacem invenies. Etiamsi raptus fueris in tertium cælum cum Paulo, non es propterea securus de nullo malo sustinendo.Ego,inquit Jesus,ostendam illi quanta oporteat eum pro nomine meo pati.Pati ergo tibi remanet, si Deum diligere, et perpetue illi servire placeat.	If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to suffer and to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou shalt find peace. Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul unto the third heaven, thou art not on that account secure from suffering evil. I will show him, saith Jesus, what great things he must suffer for My Name’s sake. It remaineth, therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou wilt love Jesus and serve Him continually.
221	2	II.75	75	Utinam dignus esses, pro nomine Jesu aliqud pati, quam magna gloria remaneret tibi, quanta exultatio omnibus Sanctis Dei, quanta ædificatio esset proximi. Nam patientiam omnes commendant, quamvis pauci pati velint. Merito deberes modicum pati pro Christo, cum multi graviora patiantur pro mundo.	Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among all the saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour! For all men commend patience, although few be willing to practise it. Thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for Christ when many suffer heavier things for the world.
222	2	II.76	76	Scias pro certo, quia morientem te oportet ducere vitam. Et quanto unusquisque plus sibi moritur, tanto Deo magis vivere incipit. Nemo aptus est ad comprehendendum cælestia, nisi se submiserit ad portandum pro Christo adversa. Nihil Deo acceptius, nihil tibi salubrius in mundo isto, quam libenter pati pro Christo. Et si eligendum tibi esset, magis optare deberes pro Christo adversa pati, quam multis consolationibus recreari, quia Christo similior esses, et omnibus Sanctis conformior. Non enim stat meritum nostrum et profectus status nostri in multis sensualitatibus, et consolationibus, sed potius in magnis gravitatibus et tribulationibus perferendis.	Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of a dying man. And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he beginneth to live towards God. None is fit for the understanding of heavenly things, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing adversities for Christ. Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing more healthful for thyself in this world, than to suffer willingly for Christ. And if it were thine to choose, thou oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for Christ, than to be refreshed with manifold consolations, for thou wouldest be more like Christ and more conformed to all saints. For our worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and consolations, but rather in bearing many troubles and adversities.
223	2	II.77	77	Si quidem aliquid melius et utilius saluti hominum quam pati fuisset, Christus utique verbo et exemplo ostendisset. Nam et se sequentes discipulos omnesque eum sequi cupientes, manifeste ad crucem portandam hortatur, et dicit:Si quis vult venire post me, abneget semetipsum, et tollat crucem suam, et sequatur me.Omnibus ergo perlectis et scrutatis sit ista finalis conclusio:quoniam per multas tribulationes oportet nos intrare in regnum Dei.Amen.	If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable to the health of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have shown it by word and example. For both the disciples who followed Him, and all who desire to follow Him, He plainly exhorteth to bear their cross, and saith, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow Me. So now that we have thoroughly read and studied all things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. Amen.
224	3	III.1	1	Liber Tertius: De interna consolatine.	THE THIRD BOOK: ON INWARD CONSOLATION
225	3	III.2	2	I. Incipit liber de interna consolatine.	I Of the inward voice of Christ to the faithful soul
226	3	III.3	3	Audiam quid loquatur in me Dominus meus.Beata anima quæ Dominum in se loquentem audit et de ore ejus verbum consolationis accipit. Beatæ aures quæ divini susurri venas suscipiunt et de mundi hujus susurrationibus nihil advertunt. Beatæ plane aures quæ non vocem foris sonantem, sed interius auscultant veritatem loquentem et docentem. Beati oculi qui exterioribus clausi sunt, interioribus autem intenti. Beati qui interna penetrant, et ad capienda arcana cælestia magis ac magis per quotidiana exercitia se student præparare. Beati qui Deo vacare gestiunt et ab omni impedimento sæculi se excutiunt.	I will hearken what the Lord God shall say within me. Blessed is the soul which heareth the Lord speaking within it, and receiveth the word of consolation from His mouth. Blessed are the ears which receive the echoes of the soft whisper of God, and turn not aside to the whisperings of this world. Blessed truly are the ears which listen not to the voice that soundeth without, but to that which teacheth truth inwardly. Blessed are the eyes which are closed to things without, but are fixed upon things within. Blessed are they who search inward things and study to prepare themselves more and more by daily exercises for the receiving of heavenly mysteries. Blessed are they who long to have leisure for God, and free themselves from every hindrance of the world. Think on these things, O my soul, and shut the doors of thy carnal desires, so mayest thou hear what the Lord God will say within thee.
227	3	III.4	4	Animadverte hoc, o anima mea, et claude sensualitatis tuæ ostia, ut possis audire quid loquatur Deus Dominus in te. Hæc dicit dilectus tuus. Salus tua ego sum, pax tua, et vita tua. Serva te apud me, et pacem invenies. Dimitte omnia transitoria, et quære æterna. Quid sunt omnia temporalia, nisi seductoria et quid juvant omnes creaturæ, si fueris a Creatore deserta? Omnibus ergo abdicatis Creatori tuo te redde placitam et fidelem, ut veram valeas apprehendere beatitudinem.	These things saith thy Beloved, “I am thy salvation, I am thy peace and thy life. Keep thee unto Me, and thou shalt find peace.” Put away thee all transitory things, seek those things that are eternal. For what are all temporal things but deceits, and what shall all created things help thee if thou be forsaken by the Creator? Therefore put all things else away, and give thyself to the Creator, to be well pleasing and faithful to Him, that thou mayest be able to attain true blessedness.
228	3	III.5	5	Quod veritas intus loquitur sine strepitu.	II What the truth saith inwardly without noise of words
229	3	III.6	6	Loquere Domine, quia audit servus tuus. Servus tuus ego sum, da mihi intellectum, ut sciam testimonia tua.Inclina cor meum in verba oris mei. Fluat ut ros eloquium tuum, dicebant olim filii Israel ad Moysen.Loquere nobis tu, et audiemus; non loquatur Dominus nobis, ne forte moriamur.Non sic, Domine, non sic oro, sed magis cum Samuele popheta humiliter ad disideranter obsecro.Loquere Domine, quia audit servus suus.Non loquatur Moyses mihi, aut aliquis ex Prophetis, sed otius tu loquere, Domine Deus, inspirator et illuminator omnium. Prophetarum, quia tu solus sine eis potes me perfecte imbuere, illi autem sine te nihil proficient.	Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth. I am Thy servant; O give me understanding that I may know Thy testimonies. Incline my heart unto the words of Thy mouth. Let thy speech distil as the dew. The children of Israel spake in old time to Moses, Speak thou unto us and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak unto us lest we die. Not thus, O Lord, not thus do I pray, but rather with Samuel the prophet, I beseech Thee humbly and earnestly, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth. Let not Moses speak to me, nor any prophet, but rather speak Thou, O Lord, who didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets; for Thou alone without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge, whilst they without Thee shall profit nothing.
230	3	III.7	7	Possunt quidem verba sonare, sed spiritum non conferunt. Pulcherrime dicunt, sed te tacente cor non accedunt. Litteras tradunt, sed tu sensum aperis. Mysteria referunt, sed tu referas intellectum signatorum. Mandata edunt, sed tu juvas ad perficiendum. Viam ostendunt, sed tu confortas ad ambulandum. Illi foris tantum agunt, sed tu corda instruis, et illuminas. Illi exterius rigant, sed tu fecunditatem donas. Illi clamant verbis, sed tu auditui intelligentiam tribuis.	They can indeed utter words, but they give not the spirit. They speak with exceeding beauty, but when Thou art silent they kindle not the heart. They give us scriptures, but Thou makest known the sense thereof. They bring us mysteries, but Thou revealest the things which are signified. They utter commandments, but Thou helpest to the fulfilling of them. They show the way, but Thou givest strength for the journey. They act only outwardly, but Thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart. They water, but Thou givest the increase. They cry with words, but Thou givest understanding to the hearer.
231	3	III.8	8	Non ergo mihi loquatur Moyses, sed tu, Domine Deus meus, æterna veritas, ne forte moriar, et sine fructu efficiar, si fuero tantum foris admonitus, et intus non accensus, ne sit mihi ad judicium verbum auditum, et non factum cognitum nec amatum creditum, et non servatum.Loquere igitur, Domine, quia audit servus tuus: verba enim vitæ æternæ habes.Loquere mihi ad qualemcumque animæ meæ consolationem, et ad totius vitæ meæ emendationem, tibi autem ad gloriam et perpetuum honorem.	Therefore let not Moses speak to me, but Thou, O Lord my God, Eternal Truth; lest I die and bring forth no fruit, being outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within; lest the word heard but not followed, known but not loved, believed but not obeyed, rise up against me in the judgment. Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth; Thou hast the words of eternal life.(4) Speak unto me for some consolation unto my soul, for the amendment of my whole life, and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of Thy Name.
232	3	III.9	9	Quod verba Dei sunt audienda cum humilitate.	III How all the words of God are to be heard with humility
233	3	III.10	10	Audi, fili mi, verba mea. Verba mea suavissima sunt, Philosophorum et Sapientum hujus mundi scientam excedentia. Verba mea spiritus et vita sunt, nec humano sunsu pensanda; non sunt ad vanam complacentiam trahenda, sed in silentio audienda, et cum omni humilitate, atque affectu magno suscipienda. Et dixi: Beatus quem tu erudieris, Domine, et de lege tua docueris eum, ut mitiges ei a diebus maliset desoletur in terra.	“My Son, hear My words, for My words are most sweet, surpassing all the knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of this world. My words are spirit, and they are life, and are not to be weighed by man’s understanding. They are not to be drawn forth for vain approbation, but to be heard in silence, and to be received with all humility and with deep love.” And I said, “Blessed is the man whom Thou teachest, O Lord, and instructest him in Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest in time of adversity, and that he be not desolate in the earth.”
234	3	III.11	11	Ego, inquit Dominus, docui Prophetas ab initio, et usque nunc non cesso omnibus loqui. Sed multi ad vocem meam surdi sunt, et muti et duri. Plures mundum libentius audiunt quam Deum, facilius sequuntur carnis suæ appetitum, quam dei beneplacitum. Promittit temporalia, et parva mundus, et servitur ei aviditate magna. Ego promitto summa, et æterna, et torpescunt mortalium corda. Quis tanta cura in omnibus mihi servit et obedit, sicut mundo et dominis ejus servitur?Erubesce, Sidon, ait mare.Et si causam quæris audi, quare. Pro modica præbenda longa via curritur, pro vita æterna vix a multis pes a terra semel movetur et levatur. Vile prætium quæritur, pro uno numismate interdum turpiter litigatur, pro vana re et parva promissione die noctuque fatigari non timetur.	“I,” saith the Lord, “taught the prophets from the beginning, and even now cease I not to speak unto all; but many are deaf and hardened against My voice; many love to listen to the world rather than to God, they follow after the desires of the flesh more readily than after the good pleasure of God. The world promiseth things that are temporal and small, and it is served with great eagerness. I promise things that are great and eternal, and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir. Who serveth and obeyeth Me in all things, with such carefulness as he serveth the world and its rulers? Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, saith the sea; And if thou reason seekest, hear thou me. For a little reward men make a long journey; for eternal life many will scarce lift a foot once from the ground. Mean reward is sought after; for a single piece of money sometimes there is shameful striving; for a thing which is vain and for a trifling promise, men shrink not from toiling day and night.”
235	3	III.12	12	Sed, proh dolor, pro bono incommutabili, pro prætio inæstimabili, pro summo honore et gloria interminabili vel ad modicum fatigari pigritatur. Erubesce ergo, serve piger et querulose, quod illi paratiores inveniuntur ad perditionem, quam te ad vitam; gaudent illi amplius ad vanitatem, quam tu ad veritatem. Equidem a spe sua nonnunquam frustrantur, sed promissio mea neminem fallit, nec confitentem mihi dimittit inanem. Quod promisi dabo, quod dix implebo, si tamen usque ad finem fidelis in dilectione mea quis permanserit. Ego remunerator sum omnium bonorum, et fortis probator omnium devotorum.	“But, O shame! for an unchangeable good, for an inestimable reward, for the highest honour and for a glory that fadeth not away, it is irksome to them to toil even a little. Be thou ashamed therefore, slothful and discontented servant, for they are found readier unto perdition than thou unto life. They rejoice more heartily in vanity than thou in the truth. Sometimes, indeed, they are disappointed of their hope, but my promise faileth no man, nor sendeth away empty him who trusteth in Me. What I have promised I will give; what I have said I will fulfil; if only a man remain faithful in My love unto the end. Therefore am I the rewarder of all good men, and a strong approver of all who are godly.
236	3	III.13	13	Scribe verba mea in corde tuo, et pertracta diligenter: erunt enim in tempore tentationis valde necessaria. Quod non intelligis, cum legis, cognosces in die visitationis. Dupliciter soleo electos meos visitare, tentatione scilicet et consolatione: et duas lectiones eis quotidie lego, unam increpando eorum vittia, alteram exhortando ad virtutum incrementa. Qui habet verba mea et spernit ea,habet qui judicet eum in novissimo die.	“Write My words in thy heart and consider them diligently, for they shall be very needful to thee in time of temptation. What thou understandest not when thou readest, thou shalt know in the time of thy visitation. I am wont to visit Mine elect in twofold manner, even by temptation and by comfort, and I teach them two lessons day by day, the one in chiding their faults, the other in exhorting them to grow in grace. He who hath My words and rejecteth them, hath one who shall judge him at the last day.”

238	3	III.15	15	Domine Deus meus, tu es omnia bona mea. Et quis ego sum, ut audeam ad te loqui? Ego sum pauperrimus servulus tuus, et abjectus vermiculus tuus, multo pauperior et contemptibilior, quam scio et dicere audeo. Memento tamen, Domine, quia nihil sum, nihil valeo, nihilque habeo. Tu solus bonus justus et sanctus; tu omnia potes, omnia præstas, omnia imples, solum peccatorem inanem relinquens. Reminiscere miserationum tuarum, Domine, et imple gratia tua cor ceum, qui non vis vacua esse opera tua.	O Lord my God, Thou art all my good, and who am I that I should dare to speak unto Thee? I am the very poorest of Thy servants, an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than I know or dare to say. Nevertheless remember, O Lord, that I am nothing, I have nothing, and can do nothing. Thou only art good, just and holy; Thou canst do all things, art over all things, fillest all things, leaving empty only the sinner. Call to mind Thy tender mercies, and fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who wilt not that Thy work should return to Thee void.
239	3	III.16	16	Quomodo possum me tolerare in hac misera vita, nisi me confortaveris misericordia tua et gratia tua. Noli avertere faciem tuam a me, noli visitationem tuam prolongare, noli consolationem tuam prolongare, noli consolationem tuam abstrahere, ne fiatanima mea sicut terra sine aqua tibi. Doce me,Domine,facere voluntatem tuam.Doce me coram te digne et humiliter conversari, quia sapientia mea tu es, qui in veritate me cognoscis, et cognovisti antequam fieret mundus, et antequam natus essem in mundo.	How can I bear this miserable life unless Thy mercy and grace strengthen me? Turn not away Thy face from me, delay not Thy visitation. Withdraw not Thou Thy comfort from me, lest my soul “gasp after thee as a thirsty land.” Lord, teach me to do Thy will, teach me to walk humbly and uprightly before Thee, for Thou art my wisdom, who knowest me in truth, and knewest me before the world was made and before I was born into the world.
240	3	III.17	17	Quod in humilitate et veritate coram Deo est conversandum.	IV How we must walk in truth and humility before God
241	3	III.18	18	Fili, ambula coram me in veritate et in simplicitate cordis tui quære me semper. Qui ambulat coram me in veritate, tutabitur ab incursibus vanis et veritas liberabit eum a seductoribus et detractionibus iniquorum. Si veritas te liberaverit, vere liber eris et non curabis de vanis hominum verbis. Domine verum est ut dicis, ita quæso mecum fiat. Veritas tua ipsa me doceat, ipsa me custodiat, et usque ad salutarem finem me conservet; ipsa me liberet ab omni affectione mala et inordinata at ambulabo tecum in magna cordis libertate.	“My Son! walk before Me in truth, and in the simplicity of thy heart seek Me continually. He who walketh before Me in the truth shall be safe from evil assaults, and the truth shall deliver him from the wiles and slanders of the wicked. If the truth shall make thee free, thou shalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for the vain words of men.” Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so with me; let Thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me safe unto the end. Let it free me from all evil and inordinate affection, and I will walk before Thee in great freedom of heart.
242	3	III.19	19	Ego te docebo, ait Veritas, quæ recta sunt et placita coram me. Cogita peccata tua cum displicentia magna et memorare, et nuquam reputes te aliquid esse propter opera bona. Revera peccator es, et multis passionibus obnoxius, et implicatus. Ex te semper ad nihil tendis, cito laberis, cito turbaris, cito dissolveris. Non habes quidquam, unde possis gloriari. Sed multa habes unde te debes vilificare, quia multo infirmior es quam vales comprehendere.	“I will teach thee,” saith the Truth, “the things which are right and pleasing before Me. Think upon thy sins with great displeasure and sorrow, and never think thyself anything because of thy good works. Verily thou art a sinner, liable to many passions, yea, tied and bound with them. Of thyself thou always tendest unto nothing, thou wilt quickly fall, quickly be conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone. Thou hast nought whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest reckon thyself vile, for thou art far weaker than thou art able to comprehend.
243	3	III.20	20	Nihil ergo tibi magnum videatur ex omnibus, quæ agis. Nihil grande, nihil prætiosum et admirabile, nil reputatione appareat dignum, nil altum, nil vere laudabile, et desiderabile, nisi quod æternum. Placeat tibi super omnia æterna veritas, displiceat tibi super omnia vilitas maxima tua. Nil sic temeas et fugias, sicut vitia, et peccata tua, quæ magis displicere debent, quam quælibet rerum damna. Quidam non sincere coram me ambulant, sed quadam curiositte et arrogania ducti volunt secreta mea scire, et alta Dei intelligere, se et suam salutem negligentes. Hi sæpe in magnas tentationes, et peccata, propter suam jactantiam, superbiam et curiositatem, labuntur me eis adversante. Time judicia Dei, expavesce iram Omnipotentis.	“Let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great; let nothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty, nothing worthy of honour, nothing lofty, nothing praiseworthy or desirable, save what is eternal. Let the eternal truth please thee above all things, let thine own great vileness displease thee continually. Fear, denounce, flee nothing so much as thine own faults and sins, which ought to be more displeasing to thee than any loss whatsoever of goods. There are some who walk not sincerely before me, but being led by curiosity and pride, they desire to know my secret things and to understand the deep things of God, whilst they neglect themselves and their salvation. These often fall into great temptations and sins because of their pride and curiosity, for I am against them.
244	3	III.21	21	Noli autem discutere opera Altissimi, sed tuas iniquitates perscrutare, in quantis dereliquisti, et quam multa bona neglexisti. Quidam portant solum suam devotionem in libris, quidam in imaginibus; quidam autem in signis exterioribus et figuris. Quidam habent me in ore, sed modicum in corde. Sunt alii qui intellectu illuminati et affectu purgati ad æterna sempe anhelant, de terrenis graviter audiunt, necessitatibus naturæ dolenter inserviunt, et hi sentiunt, quid veritatis spiritus loquitur in eis. Quia docet eos terrena despicere, et amare cælestia, mundum negligere, et cælum tota die et nocte desiderare.	“Fear thou the judgments of God, fear greatly the wrath of the Almighty. Shrink from debating upon the works of the Most High, but search narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins thou hast fallen, and how many good things thou hast neglected. There are some who carry their devotion only in books, some in pictures, some in outward signs and figures; some have Me in their mouths, but little in their hearts. Others there are who, being enlightened in their understanding and purged in their affections, continually long after eternal things, hear of earthly things with unwillingness, obey the necessities of nature with sorrow. And these understand what the Spirit of truth speaketh in them; for He teacheth them to despise earthly things and to love heavenly; to neglect the world and to desire heaven all the day and night.”
245	3	III.22	22	De mirabili affectu divini amoris.	V Of the wonderful power of the Divine Love
246	3	III.23	23	Benedico te, Pater cælestis, Pater Domini mei Jesu Christi, qui mei pauperis dignatus es recordari. O, Pater misericordiarum, et Deus totius consolationis, gratias tibi ago, qui me indignum omni consolatione quandoque tua recreas consolatione. Benedico te semper et glorifico cum unigenito Filio tuo, et Spiritu Sancto paracleto in sæcula sæculorum, amen. Eia, Domine Deus, meus amator sancte, cum tu veneris in cor meum, exultabunt omnia interiora mea. Tu es gloria mea et exultatio cordis mei, tu spes mea et refugium in die tribulationis meæ.	I bless Thee, O Heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for that Thou hast vouchsafed to think of me, poor that I am. O, Father of Mercies and God of all comfort, I give thanks unto Thee, who refreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort, when I am unworthy of any comfort. I bless and glorify Thee continually, with thine only begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, for ever and ever. O Lord God, Holy lover of my soul, when Thou shalt come into my heart, all my inward parts shall rejoice. Thou art my glory and the joy of my heart. Thou art my hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble.
247	3	III.24	24	Sed quia adhuc debilis sum in amore et impefectus in virtute, ideo necesse habeo confortari et consolari. Propterea visita me sæpius, et instrue disciplinis tuis. Libera me a passionibus pravis et malis, et sana cor meum ab omnibus affectionibus inordinatis, ut intus sanatus et bene purgatus aptus efficiar ad amandum, fortis ad patiendum, stabilis ad perseverandum.	But because I am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue, I need to be strengthened and comforted by Thee; therefore visit Thou me often and instruct me with Thy holy ways of discipline. Deliver me from evil passions, and cleanse my heart from all inordinate affections, that, being healed and altogether cleansed within, I may be made ready to love, strong to suffer, steadfast to endure.
248	3	III.25	25	Magna res est amor, magnum omnino bonum quod solum leve facit esse onerosum, et fert æqualiter omne inæquale: nam onus sine onere portat, et omne amarum dulce ac sapidum efficit. Amor Jesu nobilis ad magna operanda impellit, et desideranda semper perfectiora excitat. Amor vult esse sursum, nec ullis infimis rebus retineri. Amor vult esse liber, et ab omni mundana affectione alienus, ne internus ejus impediatur aspectus; ne per aliquod commodum temporale implicationes sustineat, aut per incommodum succumbat. Nil dulcius est amore, nil fortius, nil altius, nil latius, nil jucundius, nil plenius, nil melius in c&aeliglo et in terra, quia amor a Deo natus est, nec potest nisi in Deo super omnia creata quiescere.	Love is a great thing, a good above all others, which alone maketh every heavy burden light, and equaliseth every inequality. For it beareth the burden and maketh it no burden, it maketh every bitter thing to be sweet and of good taste. The surpassing love of Jesus impelleth to great works, and exciteth to the continual desiring of greater perfection. Love willeth to be raised up, and not to be held down by any mean thing. Love willeth to be free and aloof from all worldly affection, lest its inward power of vision be hindered, lest it be entangled by any worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity. Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier, nothing broader, nothing pleasanter, nothing fuller or better in heaven nor on earth, for love was born of God and cannot rest save in God above all created things.
249	3	III.26	26	Amans volat, currit, lætatur, liber est, et non tenetur. Dat omnia pro omnibus, et habet omnia in omnibus, quia in uno summo super omnia quiescit, ex quo omne bonum fluit et procedit. Non respicit ad dona, sed ad donantem se convertit super omnia bona. Amor sæpe modum nescit, sed super omne bonum fervescit. Amor onus non sentit, labores non reputat, plus affectat, quam valet, de impossibilitate non causatur, quia cuncta sibi licere posse arbitratur. Valet igitur ad omnia, et multa implet, et effectui mancipat. Ubi vero amans deficit et jacet, amor vigilat, et dormiens dormitat, fatigatus non laxatur, arctatus non arctatur, territus non conturbatur, sed, sicut vivax flamma et ardens favilla, sursum erumpit secureque pertransit.	He who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not hindered. He giveth all things for all things, and hath all things in all things, because he resteth in One who is high above all, from whom every good floweth and proceedeth. He looketh not for gifts, but turneth himself to the Giver above all good things. Love oftentimes knoweth no measure, but breaketh out above all measure; love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labours, striveth after more than it is able to do, pleadeth not impossibility, because it judgeth all things which are lawful for it to be possible. It is strong therefore for all things, and it fulfilleth many things, and is successful where he who loveth not faileth and lieth down. Love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch; though fatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced, though alarmed it is not terrified, but like the living flame and the burning torch, it breaketh forth on high and securely triumpheth.
250	3	III.27	27	Si quis amat, novit quid hæc vox clamat. Magnus clamor in auribus Dei est ardens affectus animæ, quæ dicit. Deus, Deus meus, amor meus, tu totus meus, et ego tuus.	If a man loveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth. For the ardent affection of the soul is a great clamour in the ears of God, and it saith: My God, my Beloved! Thou art all mine, and I am all Thine.
251	3	III.28	28	Dilata me in amore, ut discam interiori cordis ore degustare, quam suave sit amare et in amore liquefieri et natare. Tenear amore vadens supra me præ nimio fervore et stupore. Cantem amoris canticum; sequar te dilectum meum in altum. Deficit in laude tua anima mea, jubilans ex amore. Amem te plus quam me, nec me nisi propter te, et omnes in te, qui vere amant te, sicut jubet lex amoris, lucens ex te.	Enlarge Thou me in love, that I may learn to taste with the innermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love, to be dissolved, and to swim in love. Let me be holden by love, mounting above myself through exceeding fervour and admiration. Let me sing the song of love, let me follow Thee my Beloved on high, let my soul exhaust itself in Thy praise, exulting with love. Let me love Thee more than myself, not loving myself except for Thy sake, and all men in Thee who truly love Thee, as the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from Thee.
252	3	III.29	29	Est amor velox, sincerus, pius, prudens, longanimis, virilis, et seipsum nunquam quærens. Ubi enim seipsum aliquis quærit, ibi ab amore cadit. Est amor circumspectus, humilis et rectus, non mollis, non levis nec vanis intendens rebus, sobrius, stabilis, castus, quietus, et in cunctis sensibus custoditus. Est amor subjectus et obediens Prælatis, sibi vilis et despectus, Deo devotus et gratificus fidens, et semper sperans in eo, etiam cum sibi non sapit Deus, quia sine dolore non vivitur in amore.	Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong, patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never seeking her own; for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he falleth from love. Love is circumspect, humble, and upright; not weak, not fickle, nor intent on vain things; sober, chaste, steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the senses. Love is subject and obedient to all that are in authority, vile and lowly in its own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful and always trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without sorrow we cannot live in love.
253	3	III.30	30	Qui non est paratus omnia pati, et ad voluntatem stare dilecti, non est dignus amator appellari. Oportet amantem omnia dura et amara propter dilectum libenter amplecti, nec ob contraria accidentia ab eo deflecti.	He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to the will of the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of God. It behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard and bitter things for the Beloved’s sake, and not to be drawn away from Him because of any contrary accidents.
254	3	III.31	31	De probatione veri amatoris.	VI Of the proving of the true lover
255	3	III.32	32	Fili, non es adhuc fortis et prudens amator. Quare, Domine? Quia modicam propter contrarietatem deficis, accipis et nimis avide consolationem quæris. Fortis amator stat in tentationibus, nec callidis credit persuasionibus inimici. Sicut in prosperis ei placeo, ita nec in adversis displiceo.	“My Son, thou art not yet strong and prudent in thy love.” Wherefore, O my Lord? “Because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy undertakings, and too eagerly seekest after consolation. The strong lover standeth fast in temptations, and believeth not the evil persuasions of the enemy. As in prosperity I please him, so in adversity I do not displease.
256	3	III.33	33	Prudens amator non tam donum amantis, quam dantis considerat amorem. Affectum potius attendit, quam censum, et infra dilectum omnia data ponit. Nobilis amator non quiescit in dono, sed in me super omne donum. Non ideo perditum totum, si quandoque minus bene de me, vel de sanctis meis sentis, quam velles. Affectus ille bonus et dulcis, quem interdum percipis, effectus gratiæ præsentis est, et quidam prægustus patriæ cælestis, super quo non nimium innitendum est, quia vadit et venit.	“The prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so much as the love of the giver. He looketh for the affection more than the value, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved. The noble lover resteth not in the gift, but in Me above every gift. “All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My saints, less than thou shouldest desire. That good and sweet affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country; but hereon thou must not too much depend, for it goeth and cometh.
257	3	III.34	34	Certare autem adversus incidentes malos motus animi, suggestionemque spernere diaboli, insigne est virtutis et magni meriti. Non ergo te conturbent alienæ phantasiæ de quacumque materia ingestæ. Forte serva propositum, et intentionem rectam ad Deum. Non est illusio, quod aliquando in excessum subito raperis et statim ad ineptias solitas cordis reverteris. Illas enim magis invite pateris quam agis, et quamdiu displicent, et reniteris, meritum est et non perditio.	But to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to us, and to resist the suggestions of the devil, is a token of virtue and great merit. “Therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee, whencesoever they arise. Bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright intentions towards God. It is not an illusion when thou art sometimes suddenly carried away into rapture, and then suddenly art brought back to the wonted vanities of thy heart. For thou dost rather unwillingly undergo them than cause them; and so long as they displease thee and thou strivest against them, it is a merit and no loss.
258	3	III.35	35	Scito, quod antiquus hostis omnino nititur impedire desiderium tuum in bono, et ab omni devoto exercitio evacuare, a Sanctorum cultu, a pia passionis meæ memoria, a peccatorum utili recordatione, a proprii cordis custodia, et a firmo proposito proficiendi in virtute. Multas malas cogitationes ingerit, ut tædium tibi faciat et horrorem, et ab oratione revocet et sacra lectione. Displicet sibi humilis confessio et, si posset, a sacra communione cessare faceret. Nec credas ei neque cures illum, licet tibi sæpius deceptionis tenderit laqueos. Sibi imputa, cum mala ingerit et immunda. Dicito illi: Vade, immunde spiritus, erubesce miser; vade immundus es tu, qui talia infers auribus meis. Discede a me, seductor pessime; non habebis in me partem ullam, sed Jesus mecum erit, tanquam bellator fortis, et tu stabilis confusus. Malo mori, et omnem pœnam subire, quam tibi consentire. Tace, et obmutesce; non audiam te amplius, licet mihi plures moliaris molestias.Dominus illuminatio mea, et salus mea: quem timebo? Si consistant adversum me castra, non timebit cor meum. Dominus adjutor meus et redemptor meus.	“Know thou that thine old enemy altogether striveth to hinder thy pursuit after good, and to deter thee from every godly exercise, to wit, the contemplation of the Saints, the pious remembrance of My passion, the profitable recollection of sin, the keeping of thy own heart, and the steadfast purpose to grow in virtue. He suggesteth to thee many evil thoughts, that he may work in thee weariness and terror, and so draw thee away from prayer and holy reading. Humble confession displeaseth him, and if he were able he would make thee to cease from Communion. Believe him not, nor heed him, though many a time he hath laid for thee the snares of deceit. Account it to be from him, when he suggesteth evil and unclean thoughts. Say unto him, ‘Depart unclean spirit; put on shame, miserable one; horribly unclean art thou, who bringest such things to mine ears. Depart from me, detestable deceiver; thou shalt have no part in me; but Jesus shall be with me, as a strong warrior, and thou shalt stand confounded. Rather would I die and bear all suffering, than consent unto thee. Hold thy peace and be dumb; I will not hear thee more, though thou plottest more snares against me. The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear? Though a host of men should rise up against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid. The Lord is my strength and my Redeemer.’
259	3	III.36	36	Certa tanquam miles bonus; et si interdum ex fragilitate corruis, resume vires fortiores prioribus, confidens de ampliori gratia mea, et multum præcave a vana complacentia et superbia. Propter hoc multi in errorem ducuntur, et in cecitatem pæne incurabilem quandoque labuntur. Sit tibi in cautelam et perpetuam humilitatem ruina hæc superborum et de se stulte præsumentium.	“Strive thou like a good soldier; and if sometimes thou fail through weakness, put on thy strength more bravely than before, trusting in My more abundant grace, and take thou much heed of vain confidence and pride. Because of it many are led into error, and sometimes fall into blindness well-nigh irremediable. Let this ruin of the proud, who foolishly lift themselves up, be to thee for a warning and a continual exhortation to humility.”
260	3	III.37	37	De occultanda gratia sub humilitatis custodia.	VII Of hiding our grace under the guard of humility
261	3	III.38	38	Fili, utilius est tibi et securius devotionis gratiam abscondere nec in altum te efferre, nec multum inde loqui, neque multum ponderare, sed magi teipsum despicere, et tanquam indigno datam timere. Non est huic affectioni tenacius inhærendum, quæ citius potest mutari in contrarium. Cogita quam miser in gratia, et inops esse soles sine gratia. Nec est in eo tantum spiritualis vitæ profectus, cum consolationis habueris gratiam, sed cum humiliter, et abnegate patienterque tuleris ejus subtractionem. Ita quod tunc ab orationis studio non torpeas, nec reliqua opera tua ex usu facienda omnino dilabi permittas, sed sicut potueris melius et intellexeris, libenter quod est in te facias, nec propter ariditatem sive anxietatem mentis quam sentis te totaliter negligas.	“My Son, it is better and safer for thee to hide the grace of devotion, and not to lift thyself up on high, nor to speak much thereof, nor to value it greatly; but rather to despise thyself, and to fear as though this grace were given to one unworthy thereof. Nor must thou depend too much upon this feeling, for it can very quickly be turned into its opposite. Think when thou art in a state of grace how miserable and poor thou art wont to be without grace. Nor is there advance in spiritual life in this alone, that thou hast the grace of consolation, but that thou humbly and unselfishly and patiently takest the withdrawal thereof; so that thou cease not from the exercise of prayer, nor suffer thy other common duties to be in anywise neglected; rather do thy task more readily, as though thou hadst gained more strength and knowledge; and do not altogether neglect thyself because of the dearth and anxiety of spirit which thou feelest.
262	3	III.39	39	Multi enim sunt qui, cum non bene eis successerit, statim impatientes fiunt aut desides.Nonenim semperestin potestatehominis via ejus,sed Dei est dare et consolari, quando vult et quantum vult, et cui vult, sicut sibi placuerit, et non amplius. Quidam incauti propter devotionis gratiam se ipsos destruxerunt, quia plus agere voluerunt quam potuerunt, non pensantes suæ parvitatis mensuram sed magis cordis affectum sequentes, quam rationis judicium. Et quia majora præsumserunt, quam Deo placitum fuit, idcirco gratiam perdiderunt cito, et facti sunt inopes, et viles relicti, qui in cælum posuerant nidum sibi: ut humiliati et depauperati discant non in alis suis volare, sed sub pennis meis sperare. Qui adhuc novi sunt et imperiti in via Domini, nisi consilio discretorum se regant, faciliter decipi possunt et illudi.	“For there are many who, when things have not gone prosperous with them, become forthwith impatient or slothful. For the way of a man is not in himself, but it is God’s to give and to console, when He will, and as much as He will, and whom He will, as it shall please Him, and no further. Some who were presumptuous because of the grace of devotion within them, have destroyed themselves, because they would do more than they were able, not considering the measure of their own littleness, but rather following the impulse of the heart than the judgment of the reason. And because they presumed beyond what was well-pleasing unto God, therefore they quickly lost grace. They became poor and were left vile, who had built for themselves their nest in heaven; so that being humbled and stricken with poverty, they might learn not to fly with their own wings, but to put their trust under My feathers. They who are as yet new and unskilled in the way of the Lord, unless they rule themselves after the counsel of the wise, may easily be deceived and led away.
263	3	III.40	40	Quod si sentire suum magis sequi, quam aliis exercitatis credere volunt, erit eis periculosus exitus, sed tamen retrahi a proprio conceptu non valuerint. Raro sibi ipsis sapientes, ab aliis regi humiliter patiuntur. Melius est modicum sapere cum humilitate, et parva intelligentia quam magi scientiarum thesauri cum vana complacentia. Melius est minus habere, quam multum, unde osses superbire. Non satis discrete agit, qui se totum lætitiæ tradidit, obliviscens pristinæ inopiæ suæ, et casti timoris Domini, qui non timet gratiam oblatam amittere. Non etiam satis virtuose sapit, qui tempore adversitatis et cujuscumque gravitatis nimis desperate se gerit, et minus fidenter de me, quam oportet, cogitat ac sentit.	“But if they wish to follow their own fancies rather than trust the experience of others, the result will be very dangerous to them if they still refuse to be drawn away from their own notion. Those who are wise in their own conceits, seldom patiently endure to be ruled by others. It is better to have a small portion of wisdom with humility, and a slender understanding, than great treasures of sciences with vain self-esteem. It is better for thee to have less than much of what may make thee proud. He doeth not very discreetly who giveth up himself entirely to joy, forgetting his former helplessness and the chaste fear of the Lord, which feareth to lose the grace offered. Nor is he very wise, after a manly sort, who in time of adversity, or any trouble whatsoever, beareth himself too despairingly, and feeleth concerning Me less trustfully than he ought.
264	3	III.41	41	Qui tempore pacis nimis securus esse voluerit, sæpe tempore belli nimis dejectus et formidolosus reperietur. Si scires semper humilis et modicus in te permanere necnon spiritum tuum bene moderare et regere, non incideres tam cito in periculum et offensam.	“He who in time of peace willeth to be oversecure shall be often found in time of war overdispirited and full of fears. If thou knewest always how to continue humble and moderate in thyself, and to guide and rule thine own spirit well, thou wouldest not so quickly fall into danger and mischief.
265	3	III.42	42	Consilium bonum est ut fervoris spiritu concepto mediteris quid futurum sit abscedente lumine. Quod dum contigerit, recognita, ac denuo lucem posses reverti, quam ad cautelam tibi, mihi autem ad gloriam, ad tempus subtraxi. Utilior enim est sæpe talis probatio, quam si semper prospera pro tua haberes voluntate. Nam merita non sunt ex hoc extimanda, si quis plures visiones aut consolationes habeat, vel si peritus sit in Scripturis, aut in altiori gradu ponatur: sed si fuerit vera humilitate fundatus, et divina charitate repletus; si Dei honorem pure et integre semper quærat, si se ipsum nihil reputet, et in veritate despiciat atque ab aliis etiam despici et humiliari magis gaudeat quam honorari.	It is good counsel that when fervour of spirit is kindled, thou shouldest meditate how it will be with thee when the light is taken away. Which when it doth happen, remember that still the light may return again, which I have taken away for a time for a warning to thee, and also for mine own glory. Such a trial is often more useful than if thou hadst always things prosperous according to thine own will. “For merits are not to be reckoned by this, that a man hath many visions or consolations, or that he is skilled in the Scriptures, or that he is placed in a high situation; but that he is grounded upon true humility and filled with divine charity, that he always purely and uprightly seeketh the honour of God, that he setteth not by himself, but unfeignedly despiseth himself, and even rejoiceth to be despised and humbled by others more than to be honoured.”
266	3	III.43	43	De vili exstimatione sui ipsius in oculis Dei.	VIII Of a low estimation of self in the sight of God
267	3	III.44	44	Loquar at Dominum meum, cum sim pulvis et cinis?Si me amplius reputavero, ecce tu stas contra me; et dicunt te testimonium verum iniquitates meæ nec possum contradicere. Si autem me vilificavero et ad nihilum me redegero, et ab omni propria reputatione defecero, atque sicut sum spulverizavero erit, mihi propitia gratia tua, et vicina cordi meo lux tua, et omnis exstimatio, quantulacumque minima, in valle nihilitatis meæ submergetur, et peribit in æternum. Ibi ostendes me mihi, quid sum, quid fui, et de quo veni,quia nihil sum et nescivi.Se mihi ipsi relinquor, ecce nihil, et tota infirmitas; si autem subito me respexeris, statim fortis efficior, et novo repleor gaudio. Et mirum valde quod sic repente sublevor, et tam benigne a te complector, qui proprio pondere semper ad imi feror.	I will speak unto my Lord who am but dust and ashes. If I count myself more, behold Thou standest against me, and my iniquities bear true testimony, and I cannot gainsay it. But if I abase myself, and bring myself to nought, and shrink from all self-esteem, and grind myself to dust, which I am, Thy grace will be favourable unto me, and Thy light will be near unto my heart; and all self-esteem, how little soever it be, shall be swallowed up in the depths of my nothingness, and shall perish for ever. There Thou showest to me myself, what I am, what I was, and whither I have come: so foolish was I and ignorant. If I am left to myself, behold I am nothing, I am all weakness; but if suddenly Thou look upon me, immediately I am made strong, and filled with new joy. And it is great marvel that I am so suddenly lifted up, and so graciously embraced by Thee, since I am always being carried to the deep by my own weight.
268	3	III.45	45	Facit hoc amor tuus gratis præveniens me, et in tam multis subveniens necessitatibus, a gravibus quoque custodiens me periculis, et ab innumeris, ut ver dicam, eripiens malis. Me siquidem male amando perdidi; et te solum quærendo et pure amando me et te pariter inveni, atque ex amore profundius ad nihilum me redegi. Quia tu, o Dulcissime, facis mecum supra meritum omne et supra id quod audeo sperare vel rogare.	This is the doing of Thy love which freely goeth before me and succoureth me in so many necessities, which guardeth me also in great dangers and snatcheth me, as I may truly say, from innumerable evils. For verily, by loving myself amiss, I lost myself, and by seeking and sincerely loving Thee alone, I found both myself and Thee, and through love I have brought myself to yet deeper nothingness: because Thou, O most sweet Lord, dealest with me beyond all merit, and above all which I dare ask or think.
269	3	III.46	46	Benedictus sis Deus meus, quia licet ego omnibus bonis indignus sim, tua tamen nobilitas et infinita bonitas nunquam cessat benefacere etiam ingratis, et longe a te aversis. Converte nos ad te, ut simus grati, humiles, devoti, quia salus nostra es tu, virtus et fortitudo nostra.	Blessed be Thou, O my God, because though I be unworthy of all Thy benefits, Thy bountiful and infinite goodness never ceaseth to do good even to ingrates and to those who are turned far from Thee. Turn Thou us unto Thyself, that we may be grateful, humble, and godly, for Thou art our salvation, our courage, and our strength.
270	3	III.47	47	Quod omnia ad Deum sicut ad finem ultimum sunt referenda.	IX That all things are to be referred to God, as the final end
271	3	III.48	48	Fili, ego debeo esse finis tuus supremus. Ex hac intentione purificabitur affectus tuus, sæpius ad se ipsum, et ad creaturas male incurvatus. Nam si te ipsum in aliquo quæris, statim in te deficies et arescis. Omnia ergo ad me principaliter referas qui omnia sum, qui omnia dedi. Sic singula considera sicut ex summo bono manantia. Et ideo ad me tanquam ad originem suam cuncta sunt referenda.	“My Son, I must be thy Supreme and final end, if thou desirest to be truly happy. Out of such purpose thy affection shall be purified, which too often is sinfully bent upon itself and upon created things. For if thou seekest thyself in any matter, straightway thou wilt fail within thyself and grow barren. Therefore refer everything to Me first of all, for it is I who gave thee all. So look upon each blessing as flowing from the Supreme Good, and thus all things are to be attributed to Me as their source.
272	3	III.49	49	Ex me pusillus et magnus, pauper et dives, tanquam ex fonte vivo aquam hauriunt vivam. Et qui mihi sponte et libere deserviunt, gratiam, pro gratia accipient. Qui autem extra me voluerit gloriari vel in aliquo privato bono delectari, non stabilietur in vero gaudio, nec in corde suo dilatabitur, sed multipliciter impedietur et angustiabitur. Nihil ergo tibi de bono adscribere debes, nec alicui homini virtutem attribuas, sed totum da Deo, sine quo nihil habet homo. Ego totum dedi, ego totum rehabere volo, et cum magna districtione gratiarum actiones requiro.	“From Me the humble and great, the poor and the rich, draw water as from a living fountain, and those who serve Me with a free and faithful spirit shall receive grace for grace. But he who will glory apart from Me, or will be delighted with any good which lieth in himself, shall not be established in true joy, nor shall be enlarged in heart, but shall be greatly hindered and thrown into tribulation. Therefore thou must not ascribe any good to thyself, nor look upon virtue as belonging to any man, but ascribe it all unto God, without whom man hath nothing. I gave all, I will receive all again, and with great strictness require I the giving of thanks.
273	3	III.50	50	Hæc est veritas qua fugatur gloriæ vanitas. Et si intraverit cælestis gratia et vera charitas, non erit aliqua invidia, nec contractio cordis, neqe privatus amor occupabit. Vincit enim omnia divina charitas, et dilatat omnes animæ vires. Si recte sapis, in me solo gaudebis, in me solo sperabis,quia nemo bonus nisi solus Deus,qui est super omnia laudandus, et in omnibus benedicendus.	“This is the Truth, and by it the vanity of boasting is put to flight. And if heavenly grace and true charity shall enter into thee, there shall be no envy, nor straitening of the heart, nor shall any self-love take possession of thee. For divine charity conquereth all things, and enlargeth all the powers of the soul. If thou art truly wise, thou wilt rejoice in Me alone, thou wilt hope in Me alone; for there is none good but one, that is God, Who is to be praised above all things, and in all things to receive blessing.”
274	3	III.51	51	Quod spreto mundo dulce est servire Deo.	X That it is sweet to despise the world and to serve God
275	3	III.52	52	Nunc iterum loquar, Domine, et non silebo. Dicam in auribus Dei mei, et Regis mei qui est in excelso.O, quam magna est multitudo dulcedinis tuæ, Domine, quam abscondisti timentibus te.Sed quid es amantibus te? Quid toto corde tibi servientibus? Vere ineffabilis dulcedo contemplationis tuæ, quam largiris amantibus te. In hoc maxime ostendisti dulcedinem charitatis tuæ, quia cum no essem, fecisti me, et cum errarem longe a te, reduxisti me, ut servirem tibi, et præcepisti ut diligam te.	Now will I speak again, O my Lord, and hold not my peace; I will say in the ears of my God, my Lord, and my King, who is exalted above all, Oh how plentiful is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee! But what art Thou to those who love Thee? What to those who serve Thee with their whole heart? Truly unspeakable is the sweetness of the contemplation of Thee, which Thou bestowest upon those who love Thee. In this most of all Thou hast showed me the sweetness of Thy charity, that when I was not, Thou madest me, and when I wandered far from Thee, Thou broughtest me back that I might serve Thee, and commandedst me to love Thee.
276	3	III.53	53	O, fons amoris perpetui, quid dicam de te? Quomodo potero tui oblivisci, qui mei recordari dignatus es? Et postquam contabui, et perii, fecisti ultra omnem spem misericordiam cum servo tuo, et ultra omne meritum gratiam et amicitiam exhibuisti. Quid retribuam tibi pro gratia ista? Non enim omnibus datum est, ut omnibus abdicatis sæculo renuntient, et monasticam vitam assumant. Nonquid non magnum est ut tibi serviam, cui omnis creatura servire tenetur? Non magnum mihi videri debet? Sed potius hoc mihi magnum et admirandum paret, quod tam pauperem et indignum dignaris in servum recipere, et dilectis servis tuis adunare.	O Fountain of perpetual love, what shall I say concerning Thee? How shall I be unmindful of Thee, who didst vouchsafe to remember me, even after I pined away and perished? Thou hast had mercy beyond all hope upon Thy servant, and hast showed Thy grace and friendship beyond all deserving. What reward shall I render Thee for this Thy grace? For it is not given unto all to renounce this world and its affairs, and to take up a religious life. For is it a great thing that I should serve Thee, whom every creature ought to serve? It ought not to seem a great thing to me to serve Thee; but rather this appeareth to me a great and wonderful thing, that Thou vouchsafest to receive as Thy servant one so poor and unworthy, and to join him unto Thy chosen servants.
277	3	III.54	54	Ecce omnia tua sunt quæ habeo, et unde tibi servio. Verumtamen vice versa tu mihi magis servis, quam ego tibi. Ecce cælum et terra, quæ in ministerio hominis creasti, præsto sunt et faciunt quotidie quæcumque mandasti. Et hoc parum est: quin etiam Angelos in ministerio hominis creasti et ordinasti. Transcendit autem hæc omnia, quod tu homini servire dignatus es, et te ispum daturum promisisti.	Behold all things which I have are Thine, and with them I serve Thee. And yet verily it is Thou who servest me, rather than I Thee. Behold the heaven and the earth which Thou hast created for the service of men; they are at Thy bidding, and perform daily whatsoever Thou dost command. Yea, and this is little; for Thou hast even ordained the Angels for the service of man. But it surpasseth even all these things, that Thou Thyself didst vouchsafe to minister unto man, and didst promise that Thou wouldest give Thyself unto him.
278	3	III.55	55	Quid dabo tibi pro istis millibus bonis? Utinam possem tibi servire cunctis diebus vitæ meæ. Utinam vel uno die dignum servitium exhibere sufficerem. Vere tu es dignus omni servitio, omni honore et laude æterna. Vere Dominus meus es, et ego pauper servus tuus, qui totis viribus teneor servire tibi, nec unquam in laudibus tuis debeo fastidire. Sic volo, sic desidero, et quidquid mihi deest, tu digneris supplere.	What shall I render unto Thee for all these Thy manifold mercies? Oh that I were able to serve Thee all the days of my life! Oh that even for one day I were enabled to do Thee service worthy of Thyself! For verily Thou art worthy of all service, all honour, and praise without end. Verily Thou art my God, and I am Thy poor servant, who am bound to serve Thee with all my strength, nor ought I ever to grow weary of Thy praise. This is my wish, this is my exceeding great desire, and whatsoever is lacking to me, vouchsafe Thou to supply.
279	3	III.56	56	Magnus honor, magna gloria tibi servire, et omnia per te, propter te contemnere. Habebunt enim gratiam magnam, qui sponte se subjecerint tuæ sanctissimæ servituti, et invenient suavissimam Spiritus Sancti consolationem. Consequentur magnam cordis libertatem, qui pro nomine tuo arctam ingrediuntur viam, et omnem mundanam neglexerint curam.	It is great honour, great glory to serve Thee, and to despise all for Thy sake. For they shall have great grace who of their own will shall submit themselves to Thy most holy service. They who for Thy love have cast away every carnal delight shall find the sweetest consolation of the Holy Ghost. They who enter the narrow way of life for Thy Name’s sake, and have put away all worldly cares, shall attain great liberty of spirit.
280	3	III.57	57	O, grata et jucunda Dei servitus, qua homo veraciter efficitur liber et sanctus. O, sacer status religiosi famulatus, qui hominem Angelis reddit æqualem, Deo placabilem, dæmonibus terribilem, et cunctis fidelibus commendabilem. O, amplectendum et semper optandum servitium, quo promeretur summum bonum, et gaudium promeretur sine fine permansurum.	Oh grateful and delightsome service of God, whereby man is made truly free and holy! Oh sacred condition of the religious servant, which maketh man equal to the Angels, well-pleasing unto God, terrible to evil spirits, and acceptable to all faithful ones! Oh service to be embraced and ever desired, in which the highest good is promised, and joy is gained which shall remain for evermore!
281	3	III.58	58	Quod desideria cordis examinanda sunt et moderanda.	XI That the desires of the heart are to be examined and governed
282	3	III.59	59	Fili, oportet te adhuc multa discere, quæ necdum bene didicisti. Quæ sunt hæc, Domine? ut desiderium tuum ponas totaliter secundum beneplacitum meum, et tui ipsius amator non sis: sed meæ voluntatis cupidus amator et æmulator. Desideria te sæpe accendunt, et vehementer impellunt; sed considera an propter meum, an propter honorem tuum vel commodum magis movearis. Si ego sum in causa, bene contentus eris quomodocumque ordinavero. Si autem de proprio quæstu aliquid latet, ecce hoc est quod te impedit et gravat.	“My Son, thou hast still many things to learn, which thou hast not well learned yet.” What are they, Lord? “To place thy desire altogether in subjection to My good pleasure, and not to be a lover of thyself, but an earnest seeker of My will. Thy desires often excite and urge thee forward; but consider with thyself whether thou art not more moved for thine own objects than for My honour. If it is Myself that thou seekest, thou shalt be well content with whatsoever I shall ordain; but if any pursuit of thine own lieth hidden within thee, behold it is this which hindereth and weigheth thee down.
283	3	III.60	60	Cave ergo ne nimium innitaris super desiderio præconcepto, me non consulto, ne forte postea pæniteat et displiceat quod primo placuit, et quasi pro meliore zelasti. Non enim omnis affectio, quæ videtur bona, statim est sequenda: sed neque omnis contraria affectio ad primum fugienda. Expedit interdum refrænatione uti, etiam in bonis studiis et desideriis, ne per importunitatem mentis distractionem incurra, ne aliis per indisciplinationem scandalum generes, vel etiam per resistentiam aliorum subito turberis et corruas.	“Beware, therefore, lest thou strive too earnestly after some desire which thou hast conceived, without taking counsel of Me; lest haply it repent thee afterwards, and that displease thee which before pleased, and for which thou didst long as for a great good. For not every affection which seemeth good is to be forthwith followed; neither is every opposite affection to be immediately avoided. Sometimes it is expedient to use restraint even in good desires and wishes, lest through importunity thou fall into distraction of mind, lest through want of discipline thou become a stumbling-block to others, or lest by the resistance of others thou be suddenly disturbed and brought to confusion.
284	3	III.61	61	Interdum vero oportet violentia uti, et viriliter appetitui sensitivo contraire, nec advertere quid velit caro, et quid non velit; sed hoc magis fatagere ut subjecta sit etiam nolens spiritui, et tamdiu castigari debet et cogi servituti subesse, donec parata sit ad omnia, paucisque contentari discat, et simplicibus delectari nec contra aliquod inonveniens murmurare.	“Sometimes, indeed, it is needful to use violence, and manfully to strive against the sensual appetite, and not to consider what the flesh may or not will; but rather to strive after this, that it may become subject, however unwillingly, to the spirit. And for so long it ought to be chastised and compelled to undergo slavery, even until it be ready for all things, and learn to be contented with little, to be delighted with things simple, and never to murmur at any inconvenience.”
285	3	III.62	62	De informatione patientiæ, et luctamine adversus concupiscentias.	XII Of the inward growth of patience, and of the struggle against evil desires
286	3	III.63	63	Domine Deus, ut audio, patientia est mihi valde necessaria. Multa enim in hac vita accidunt contraria. Nam qualitercumque ordinavero de pace mea, non potes esse sine dolore et bello vita mea. Ita est, fili. Non enim volo te talem quærere pacem, quæ tentationibus careat, aut contraria non sentiat; sed tunc etiam te extimare pacem invenisse, cum tu fueris variis tribulationibus exercitatus, et in multis contrarietatibus probatus.	O Lord God, I see that patience is very necessary unto me; for many things in this life fall out contrary. For howsoever I may have contrived for my peace, my life cannot go on without strife and trouble. “Thou speakest truly, My Son. For I will not that thou seek such a peace as is without trials, and knoweth no adversities; but rather that thou shouldest judge thyself to have found peace, when thou art tried with manifold tribulations, and proved by many adversities.
287	3	III.64	64	Si dixeris te non multa posse pati, quomodo tunc sustinebis ignem purgatorii? De duobus malis semper minus tamen est eligendum: ut ergo æterna futura supplicia possis evadere, mala præsentia studeas pro Deo æquanimiter tolerare. An putas quod homines sæculi hujus nihil, aut parum patiantur? Nec hoc invenies, etiamsi delicatissimos quæsieris. Sed habent, inquies, multas delectationes, et proprias sequuntur voluntates: ideoque parum ponderant suas tribulationes. Esto quod ita sit, quod habeant quidquid voluerint, sed quamdiu putas durabit?	If thou shalt say that thou art not able to bear much, how then wilt thou sustain the fire hereafter? Of two evils we should always choose the less. Therefore, that thou mayest escape eternal torments hereafter, strive on God’s behalf to endure present evils bravely. Thinkest thou that the children of this world suffer nought, or but little? Thou wilt not find it so, even though thou find out the most prosperous. “‘But,’ thou wilt say, ‘they have many delights, and they follow their own wills, and thus they bear lightly their tribulations.’ “Be it so, grant that they have what they list; but how long, thinkest thou, will it last?
288	3	III.65	65	Ecce quemadmodum sumus deficient in sæculo abundantes, et nulla erit recordatio præteritorum gaudiorum. Sed et cum adhuc vivunt, non sine amaritudine et tædio ac timore in eis quiescunt. Ex eadem namque re, unde delectationem concipiunt, sibi inde doloris pœnam frequenter recipiunt. Juste illis fit ut quia inordinate delectationes quærunt et sequuntur, non sine amaritudine et confusione eas expleant.	Behold, like the smoke those who are rich in this world will pass away, and no record shall remain of their past joys. Yea, even while they yet live, they rest not without bitterness and weariness and fear. For from the very same thing wherein they find delight, thence they oftentimes have the punishment of sorrow. Justly it befalleth them, that because out of measure they seek out and pursue pleasures, they enjoy them not without confusion and bitterness.
289	3	III.66	66	O, quam breves, quam falsæ, quam inordinatæ, et turpes omnes sunt. Verumtamen præ ebrietate et cæcitate non intelligunt, sed velut muta animalia, propter modicum corruptibilis vitæ delectamentum, mortem animæ incurrunt. Tu ergo, fili,post concupiscentias tuas non eas: et a voluntate tua avertere; delectare in Domino, et dabit tibi petitiones cordis tui.	Oh how short, how false, how inordinate and wicked are all these pleasures! Yet because of their sottishness and blindness men do not understand; but like brute beasts, for the sake of a little pleasure of this corruptible life, they incur death of the soul. Thou therefore, my son, go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites. Delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee thy heart’s desire.
290	3	III.67	67	Etenim si veraciter vis delectari, et abundantius a me consolari, ecce in contemtu omnium mundanorum, et in abscissione omnium infirmarum delectationum erit benedictio tua, et copiosa tibi reddetur consolatio. Et quanto plus te ab omni creaturarum solatio subtraxeris, tanto in me suaviores et potentiores consolationes invenies. Sed primo non sine quadam tristitia et labore certaminis ad has pertinges. Obsistet inolita consuetudo, sed meliori consuetudine devincetur. Remurmurabit caro, sed fervore spiritus frænabitur. Instigabit te et exacerbabit serpens antiquus sed oratione fugabitur, insuper et labore utili aditus ei magnus obstruetur.	“For if thou wilt truly find delight, and be abundantly comforted of Me, behold in the contempt of all worldly things and in the avoidance of all worthless pleasures shall be thy blessing, and fulness of consolation shall be given thee. And the more thou withdrawest thyself from all solace of creatures, the more sweet and powerful consolations shalt thou find. But at the first thou shalt not attain to them, without some sorrow and hard striving. Long-accustomed habit will oppose, but it shall be overcome by better habit. The flesh will murmur again and again, but will be restrained by fervour of spirit. The old serpent will urge and embitter thee, but will be put to flight by prayer; moreover, by useful labour his entrance will be greatly obstructed.”
291	3	III.68	68	De obedientia humili subditi, ad exemplum Jesu Christi.	nan
292	3	III.69	69	Fili, qui se subtrahere nititur ab obedientia, ipse se subtrahit a gratia et qui quærit habere privata, amittit communia. Qui non libenter, et sponte suo superiori se subdit: signum est quod caro sua nondum perfecte sibi obedit, sed sæpe recalcitrat et murmurat. Disce ergo celeriter superiori tuo te submittere, si carnem propriam optas subjugare. Citius namque exterior vincitur inimicus, si interior homo non fuerit devastatus. Non est molestior et pejor animæ hostis, quam tu ipse tibi, non bene concordans spiritui. Oportet enim te verum assumere tui ipsius contemtum, si vis prævalere adversus carnem, et sanguinem, quia adhuc nimis inordinate te diligis: ideo plene te resignare aliorum voluntati trepidas.	“My Son, he who striveth to withdraw himself from obedience, withdraweth himself also from grace, and he who seeketh private advantages, loseth those which are common unto all. If a man submit not freely and willingly to one set over him, it is a sign that his flesh is not yet perfectly subject to himself, but often resisteth and murmureth. Learn therefore quickly to submit thyself to him who is over thee, if thou seekest to bring thine own flesh into subjection. For the outward enemy is very quickly overcome if the inner man have not been laid low. There is no more grievous and deadly enemy to the soul than thou art to thyself, if thou art not led by the Spirit. Thou must not altogether conceive contempt for thyself, if thou wilt prevail against flesh and blood. Because as yet thou inordinately lovest thyself, therefore thou shrinkest from yielding thyself to the will of others.
293	3	III.70	70	Sed quid magnum tu, qui pulvis es, et nihil, si propter Deum te subdis homini, quando eo Omnipotens et Altissimus, qui cuncta creavi ex nihilo, me homini propter te subjeci humiliter. Factus sum omnium humillimus, et infimus, ut etiam superbiam mea humilitate vinceres. Disce obtemperare, pulvis, dice te humiliare, terra et limus, et sub omnium pedibus incurvare. Disce voluntates tuas frangere, et ad omnem subjectionem te dare.	“But what great thing is it that thou, who art dust and nothingness, yieldest thyself to man for God’s sake, when I, the Almighty and the Most High, who created all things out of nothing, subjected Myself to man for thy sake? I became the most humble and despised of men, that by My humility thou mightest overcome thy pride. Learn to obey, O dust! Learn to humble thyself, O earth and clay, and to bow thyself beneath the feet of all. Learn to crush thy passions, and to yield thyself in all subjection.
294	3	III.71	71	Exardesce contra te, nec patiaris tumorem in te vivere, sed ita subjectum et pulverem te exhibe, ut omnes super te ambulare possint, et sicut lutum platearum conculcare. Quid habes, homo inanis, conqueri? Quid, sordide peccator, potes contradicere exprobrantibus tibi, qui toties Deum offendisti et toties infernum meruisti? Sed pepercit tibi oculus meus, quia prætiosa fuit anima tua in conspectu meo, ut cognosceres dilectionem meam, et gratus semper beneficiis meis existeres et ad veram subjectionem et humilitatem te jugiter dares, patienterque proprium contemtum ferres.	“Be zealous against thyself, nor suffer pride to live within thee, but so show thyself subject and of no reputation, that all may be able to walk over thee, and tread thee down as the clay in the streets. What hast thou, O foolish man, of which to complain? What, O vile sinner, canst thou answer those who speak against thee, seeing thou hast so often offended God, and many a time hast deserved hell? But Mine eye hath spared thee, because thy soul was precious in My sight; that thou mightest know My love, and mightest be thankful for My benefits; and that thou mightest give thyself altogether to true subjection and humility, and patiently bear the contempt which thou meritest.”
295	3	III.72	72	De judiciis Dei occultis considerandis, ne extollamur in bonis.	XIV Of meditation upon the hidden judgments of God, that we may not be lifted up because of our well-doing
296	3	III.73	73	Intonas super me judicia tua, Domine, et timore ac tremore concutis omnia ossa mea et expavescit anima mea valde. Sto attonitus et considero, quiacæli non sunt mundi in conspectu tuo. Si in Angelis reperisti pravitatem,nec tamen epercisti, quid fiet de me. Ceciderunt stellæ de cælo, et ego pulvis quid præsumo? Quorum opra videbantur laudabilia, ceciderunt ad infima, et qui comedebant panem Angelorum, vidi siliquis delectari porcorum.	hou sendest forth Thy judgments against me, O Lord, and shakest all my bones with fear and trembling, and my soul trembleth exceedingly. I stand astonished, and remember that the heavens are not clean in thy sight. If Thou chargest Thine angels with folly, and didst spare them not, how shall it be unto me? Stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall I dare who am but dust? They whose works seemed to be praiseworthy, fell into the lowest depths, and they who did eat Angels’ food, them have I seen delighted with the husks that the swine do eat.
297	3	III.74	74	Nulla est ergo sanctitas, si manum tuam retrahas, Domine. Nulla sapientia prodest, si gubernare desistas. Nulla juvat fortitudo, si conservare desinas. Nulla secura castitas, si eam non protegas. Nulla propria prodest custodia, si non adsit tua sancta vigilantia. Nam relicti mergimur et perimus; visitati autem: vivimus et erigimur. Instabiles quippe sumus, sed propter te confirmamur; tepescimus, sed a te accendimur.	There is therefore no holiness, if Thou O Lord, withdraw Thine hand. No wisdom profiteth, if Thou leave off to guide the helm. No strength availeth, if Thou cease to preserve. No purity is secure, if Thou protect it not. No self-keeping availeth, if Thy holy watching be not there. For when we are left alone we are swallowed up and perish, but when we are visited, we are raised up, and we live. For indeed we are unstable, but are made strong through Thee; we grow cold, but are rekindled by Thee.
298	3	III.75	75	O, quam humiliter et abjecte mihi de me ipso sentiendum est, quam nihili pendendum est si quid boni videor habere. O, quam profunde me submittere debeo sub abyssalibus tuis judiciis, Domine; ubi nihil aliud me esse invenio, quam nihil et nihil. O, pondus immensum, o pelagus instransnatabile, ubi nihil de me reperio, quam in totum nihil. Ubi est ergo latebra gloriæ? Ubi confidentia de gloria concepta? Absorpta est omnis gloria vana in profunditate judiciorum tuorum super me.	Oh, how humbly and abjectly must I reckon of myself, how must I weigh it as nothing, if I seem to have nothing good! Oh, how profoundly ought I to submit myself to Thy unfathomable judgments, O Lord, when I find myself nothing else save nothing, and again nothing! Oh weight unmeasurable, oh ocean which cannot be crossed over, where I find nothing of myself save nothing altogether! Where, then, is the hiding-place of glory, where the confidence begotten of virtue? All vain-glory is swallowed up in the depths of Thy judgments against me.
299	3	III.76	76	Quid est omni caro in conspectu tuo?Numquid gloriabitur lutum contra formantem se?Quomodo potest erigi vaniloquio, cujus cor in veritate subjectum est Deo?

Nam et ipsi qui loquuntur, ecce omnes nihil, et deficient cum sonitu verborum.VeritasautemDomini manet in æternum.	What is all flesh in Thy sight? For how shall the clay boast against Him that fashioned it? How can he be lifted up in vain speech whose heart is subjected in truth to God? The whole world shall not lift him up whom Truth hath subdued; nor shall he be moved by the mouth of all who praise him, who hath placed all his hope in God. For they themselves who speak, behold, they are all nothing; for they shall cease with the sound of their words, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.
300	3	III.77	77	Qualiter standum sit ad dicendum in omni re desiderabili.	XV How we must stand and speak, in everything that we desire
301	3	III.78	78	Fili, si dicas in omni re: Domine, si tibi placitum fuerit, fiat hoc ita; Domine, si sit honor tuus, fiat in nomine tuo hoc; Domine, si mihi videris expedire et utile esse probaveris, tunc da mihi hoc uti ad honorem tuum. Sed si mihi nocivum fore cognoveris, nec animæ meæ saluti prodesse, aufer a me tale desiderium. Non enim omne desiderium a Spiritu Sancto est, etiamsi homini videatur justum, rectum et bonum. Difficile est pro vero judicare, an spiritus bonus, aut malus te impellat ad desiderandum hoc vel illud, an etiam ex proprio movearis spiritu. Multi in fine sunt decepti, qui primo bono spiritu videbantur inducti.	“My Son, speak thou thus in every matter, ‘Lord, if it please Thee, let this come to pass. Lord, if this shall be for Thine honour, let it be done in Thy Name. Lord, if thou see it good for me, and approve it as useful, then grant me to use it for Thy honour. But if thou knowest that it shall be hurtful unto me, and not profitable for the health of my soul, take the desire away from me’! For not every desire is from the Holy Ghost, although it appear to a man right and good. It is difficult to judge with certainty whether a good or an evil spirit move thee to desire this or that, or whether thou art moved by thine own spirit. Many have been deceived at the last, who seemed at the beginning to be moved by a good spirit.
302	3	III.79	79	Igitur semper cum timore Dei, et humilitate cordis desiderandum est et petendum, quidquid desiderabile menti occurrit, maximeque cum propria resignatione mihi totum committendum est atque dicendum. Domine, tu scis qualiter melius est mihi hoc vel illud; sicut volueris, da mihi quod vis et quantum vis et quando vis. Fac mecum sicut scis et sicut tibi magis placuerit, et major honor fuerit tuus. Pone me ubi vis, et liber age mecum in omnibus. In manu tua ego sum, gira et reversa me per circuitum. En ego servus tuus paratus ad omnia: quoniam non desidero mihi vivere, sed tibi, utinam digne et perfecte.	“Therefore, whatsoever seemeth to thee desirable, thou must always desire and seek after it with the fear of God and humility of heart, and most of all, must altogether resign thyself, and commit all unto Me and say, ‘Lord, thou knowest what is best; let this or that be, according as Thou wilt. Give what Thou wilt, so much as Thou wilt, when Thou wilt. Do with me as Thou knowest best, and as best shall please Thee, and as shall be most to Thine honour. Place me where Thou wilt, and freely work Thy will with me in all things. I am in Thine hand, and turn me in my course. Behold, I am Thy servant, ready for all things; for I desire to live not to myself but to Thee. Oh, that I might live worthily and perfectly.’”
303	3	III.80	80	Oratio pro beneplacito faciendo Dei.	A PRAYER TO BE ENABLED TO DO GOD’S WILL PERFECTLY
304	3	III.81	81	Concede mihi, benignissime Jesu, gratiam tuam, ut mecum sit et mecum laboret, mecumque usque in finem perseveret. Da mihi semper desiderare, et velle quod tibi magis acceptum est, et charius placet. Tua voluntas mea sit, et mea voluntas tuam sequatur semper, et optime ei concordet. Sit mihi unum velle, et unum nolle tecum: nec aliud posse velle, aut nolle nisi quod vis, aut nolis.	Grant me Thy grace, most merciful Jesus, that it may be with me, and work in me, and persevere with me, even unto the end. Grant that I may ever desire and wish whatsoever is most pleasing and dear unto Thee. Let Thy will be mine, and let my will alway follow Thine, and entirely accord with it. May I choose and reject whatsoever Thou dost; yea, let it be impossible for me to choose or reject except according to Thy will.
305	3	III.82	82	Da mihi omnibus mori quæ in mundo sunt, et propter te amare contemni, et nesciri in hoc sæculo. Da mihi super omnia desiderata in te quiescere, et cor meum in te pacificare. Tu vera pax cordis, tu sola requies; extra te omnia sunt dura, et inquieta. In hacpace in idipsum, hoc est in te uno et summo et æterno bono,dormiam et requiescam. Amen.	Grant that I may die to all worldly things, and for Thy sake love to be despised and unknown in this world. Grant unto me, above all things that I can desire, to rest in Thee, and that in Thee my heart may be at peace. Thou art the true peace of the heart, Thou alone its rest; apart from Thee all things are hard and unquiet. In Thee alone, the supreme and eternal God, I will lay me down in peace and take my rest . Amen.
306	3	III.83	83	Quod verum solatium in solo Deo est quærendum.	XVI That true solace is to be sought in God alone
307	3	III.84	84	Quidquid desiderare vel cogitare possum ad solatium meum, non hic exspecto, sed in posterum: quia, si omnia solatia mundi hujus haberem, et omnibus deliciis frui possem, certum est quod diu durare no possent. Unde non potes plene, anima mea, consolari, nec perfecte recreari, nisi in Deo, consolatione pauperum et susceptore humilium. Exspecta modicum, anima mea: exspecta divinum promissum, et habebis abundantiam omnium bonorum in cælo; et, si nimis inordinate ista appetis præsentia, perdes æterna et cælestia. Sint temporalia in usu, æterna in desiderio. Non potes aliquo bono temporali satiari, quia ad hæc fruenda non es creata.	Whatsoever I am able to desire or to think of for my solace, I look for it not here, but hereafter. For if I alone had all the solaces of this world, and were able to enjoy all its delights, it is certain that they could not endure long. Wherefore, O my soul, thou canst be fully comforted and perfectly refreshed, only in God, the Comforter of the poor, and the lifter up of the humble. Wait but a little while, my soul, wait for the Divine promise, and thou shalt have abundance of all good things in heaven. If thou longest too inordinately for the things which are now, thou shalt lose those which are eternal and heavenly. Let temporal things be in the use, eternal things in the desire. Thou canst not be satisfied with any temporal good, for thou wast not created for the enjoyment of these.
308	3	III.85	85	Etsi omnia bona creata haberes, non posses esse felix et beata; sed in Deo, qui cuncta creavit, tota beatitudo tua et felicitas consistit, non qualis videtur et laudatur a stultis mundi amatoribus, sed qualem exspectant boni Christi fideles, et prægustant interdum spirituales ac mundi corde, quorumconversatio est in cælis. Vanum est et breve omne humanum solatium: beatum et verum solatium, quod intus a veritate percipitur. Devotus homo ubique fert secum consolatorem suum Jesum et dicit ad eum: Adesto mihi, Domine Jesu, in omni loco et tempore. Hæc mihi sit consolatio, libenter velle carere omni humano solatio. Et si tua defuerit consolatio, sit mihi tua voluntas, et justa probatio pro summo solatio.Non in perpetuumenimirasceris, neque in æternum comminaberis.	Although thou hadst all the good things which ever were created, yet couldst not thou be happy and blessed; all thy blessedness and thy felicity lieth in God who created all things; not such felicity as seemeth good to the foolish lover of the world, but such as Christ’s good and faithful servants wait for, and as the spiritual and pure in heart sometimes taste, whose conversation is in heaven. All human solace is empty and short-lived; blessed and true is that solace which is felt inwardly, springing from the truth. The godly man everywhere beareth about with him his own Comforter, Jesus, and saith unto Him: “Be with me, Lord Jesus, always and everywhere. Let it be my comfort to be able to give up cheerfully all human comfort. And if Thy consolation fail me, let Thy will and righteous approval be alway with me for the highest comfort. For Thou wilt not always be chiding, neither keepest Thou Thine anger for ever .”
309	3	III.86	86	Quod omnis sollicitudo in Deo ponenda est.	XVII That all care is to be cast upon God
310	3	III.87	87	Fili, sine me tecum agere quod volo: ego scio quid expediat tibi. Tu cogitas ut homo, in multis sentis, sicut tibi humanus suadet affectus.	“My Son, suffer me to do with thee what I will; I know what is expedient for thee. Thou thinkest as a man, in many things thou judgest as human affection persuadeth thee.”
311	3	III.88	88	Domine, verum est quod dicis. Major est sollicitudo tua pro me, quam omnis cura quam ego possem gerere pro me. Nimis enim casualiter stat, qui non projicit omnem sollicitudinem suam in te. Domine, dummodo voluntas mea recta et firma, in te permaneat, fac de me quidquid tibi placuerit. Non enim potest esse nisi bonum quidquid de me feceris. Si me vis esse in tenebris, sis benedictus; et si me vis esse in luce, sis iterum benedictus. Si me dignaris consolari, sis benedictus; si me vis tribulari, æque sis semper benedictus.	Lord, what Thou sayest is true. Greater is Thy care for me than all the care which I am able to take for myself. For too insecurely doth he stand who casteth not all his care upon Thee. Lord, so long as my will standeth right and firm in Thee, do with me what Thou wilt, for whatsoever Thou shalt do with me cannot be aught but good. Blessed be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in darkness: blessed also be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in light. Blessed be Thou if Thou vouchsafe to comfort me, and always blessed be Thou if Thou cause me to be troubled.
312	3	III.89	89	Fili, sic oportet te stare, si mecum desideras ambulare. Ita promtus debes esse ad patiendum, sicut ad gaudendum. Ita libenter debes esse inops et pauper, sicut plenus, et dives.	“My Son! even thus thou must stand if thou desirest to walk with Me. Thou must be ready alike for suffering or rejoicing. Thou must be poor and needy as willingly as full and rich.”
313	3	III.90	90	Domine, libenter patiar pro te sicut volueris venire super me. Indifferenter volo de manu tua bonum et malum, dulce et amarum, lætum et triste suscipere, et pro omnibus mihi contingentibus gratias agere. Custodi me ab omni peccato, et non timebo mortem neque infernum. Dummodo in æternum non projicias, nec deleas me de libro vitæ, non mihi nocebit quidquid veniret tribulationis super me.	Lord, I will willingly bear for Thee whatsoever Thou wilt have to come upon me. Without choice I will receive from Thy hand good and evil, sweet and bitter, joy and sadness, and will give Thee thanks for all things which shall happen unto me. Keep me from all sin, and I will not fear death nor hell. Only cast me not away for ever, nor blot me out of the book of life. Then no tribulation which shall come upon me shall do me hurt.
314	3	III.91	91	Quod temporales miseriæ Christi exemplo æquanimiter sunt ferendæ.	XVIII That temporal miseries are to be borne patiently after the example of Christ
315	3	III.92	92	Fili, ego descendi de cælo pro tua salute; suscepi tuas miserias, non necessitate, sed charitate trahente ut patientiam disceres et temporales miserias non indignanter ferres. Nam ab hora ortus mei usque ad exitum in cruce non defuit mihi tolerantia doloris, at defectum rerum temporalium magnum habui. Multas querimonias de me frequenter audivi, confusiones et opprobria benigne sustinui, pro miraculis blasphemias, pro doctrina reprehensiones.	“My Son! I came down from heaven for thy salvation; I took upon Me thy miseries not of necessity, but drawn by love that thou mightest learn patience and mightest bear temporal miseries without murmuring. For from the hour of My birth, until My death upon the Cross, I ceased not from bearing of sorrow; I had much lack of temporal things; I oftentimes heard many reproaches against Myself; I gently bore contradictions and hard words; I received ingratitude for benefits, blasphemies for My miracles, rebukes for My doctrine.”
316	3	III.93	93	Domine, quia fuisti patiens in vita tua, in hoc maxime implendo præceptum Patris tui, dignum est ut ego misellus peccator secundum voluntatem tuam patienter me sustineam, et donec ipse volueris, onus corruptibilis vitæ pro salute mea portem. Nam etsi sentitur onerosa præsens vita, facta est tamen jam per gratiam tuam valde meritoria, atque exemplo tuo atque Sanctorum tuorum vestigiis infirmis tolerabilior, et clarior. Sed et multo magis consolatioria, quam olim in veteri Testamento fuerat, cum porta cæli clausa persisteret, et obscurior etiam via videbatur, quando tam pauci regnum cælorum quærere curabant. Sed neque qui tunc justi erant et salvandi ante passionem tuam et sacræ mortis obitum, cæleste regnum poterant introire.	Lord, because Thou wast patient in Thy life, herein most of all fulfilling the commandment of Thy Father, it is well that I, miserable sinner, should patiently bear myself according to Thy will, and as long as Thou wilt have it so, should bear about with me for my salvation, the burden of this corruptible life. For although the present life seemeth burdensome, it is nevertheless already made very full of merit through Thy grace, and to those who are weak it becometh easier and brighter through Thy example and the footsteps of Thy saints; but it is also much more full of consolation than it was of old, under the old Testament, when the gate of heaven remained shut; and even the way to heaven seemed more obscure when so few cared to seek after the heavenly kingdom. But not even those who were then just and in the way of salvation were able, before Thy Passion and the ransom of Thy holy Death, to enter the kingdom of heaven.
317	3	III.94	94	O, quantas tibi gratias teneor referre, quia rectam et bonam viam dignatus es mihi et cinctis fidelibus ad æternum regnum ostendere tuum. Nam vita tua via nostra, et per sanctam patietiam ambulamus ad te, qui es corona nostra. Nisi tu nos præcessisses et docuisses, quis sequi curaret? Heu quanti longe retrocenderent, nisi tua præclara exempla inspicerent. Ecce adhuc tepescimus auditis tot signis tuis et doctrinis. Quid fieret si tantum lumen ad sequendum te non haberemus?	Oh what great thanks am I bound to give Thee, who hast vouchsafed to show me and all faithful people the good and right way to Thine eternal kingdom, for Thy way is our way, and by holy patience we walk to Thee who art our Crown. If Thou hadst not gone before and taught us, who would care to follow? Oh, how far would they have gone backward if they had not beheld Thy glorious example! Behold we are still lukewarm, though we have heard of Thy many signs and discourses; what would become of us if we had not such a light to help us follow Thee?
318	3	III.95	95	De tolerantia injuriarum, et quis verus patiens perhibetur.	XIX Of bearing injuries, and who shall be approved as truly patient
319	3	III.96	96	Quid est quod loqueris o fili? Cessa conqueri, considera meam et aliorum Sanctorum passionem.Nondum usque ad sanguinem restitisti. Parum est quod tu pateris in comparatione eorum, qui tam multa passi sunt, tam fortiter tentati, tam graviter tribulati, tam multipliciter probati, et exercitati. Oportet igitur aliorum graviora ad mentem reducere, ut levius feras tua minima. Et si tibi minima non videntur, vide ne et hoc tua faciat impatientia. Sive tamen parva, sive magna sint, stude cuncta patienter ferre.	“What sayest thou, My Son? Cease to complain; consider My suffering and that of My saints. Thou hast not yet resisted unto blood. It is little which thou sufferest in comparison with those who have suffered so many things, have been so strongly tempted, so grievously troubled, so manywise proved and tried. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more grievous sufferings of others that thou mightest bear thy lesser ones more easily, and if they seem not to thee little, see that it is not thy impatience which is the cause of this. But whether they be little or whether they be great, study to bear them all with patience.
320	3	III.97	97	Quanto melius te ad patiendum disponis, tanto sapientius agis, et amplius promereris et feres levius animo et usu ad hoc non segniter paratus. Nec dica: Non valeo hæc ab homine tali pati, nec hujuscemodi mihi patienda sunt: grave enim intulit damnum, et improperat mihi quæ nunquam cogitaveram; sed ab alio libenter patiar, et sicut patienda videro. Insipiens est talis cogitatio, quæ virtutem patientiæ non considerat, nec a quo coronanda erit; sed magis personas, et offensas sibi illatas perpendit.	“So far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently, so far thou dost wisely and art deserving of the more merit; thou shalt also bear the more easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained hereunto. And say not ‘I cannot bear these things from such a man, nor are things of this kind to be borne by me, for he hath done me grievous harm and imputeth to me what I had never thought: but from another I will suffer patiently, such things as I see I ought to suffer.’ Foolish is such a thought as this, for it considereth not the virtue of patience, nor by whom that virtue is to be crowned, but it rather weigheth persons and offences against self.
321	3	III.98	98	Non est verus patiens qui non vult pati, nisi quantum sibi visum fuerit, et a quo sibi placuerit. Verus autem patiens non attendit a quo homine, utrum a Prælato suo, an ab alio æquali, an inferior, utrum a bono, et sancto viro, vel a perverso, et indigno exerceatur. Sed indifferenter ab omni creatura, quantumcumque et quotiescumque ei aliquid adversi acciderit, totum hoc gratanter de manu Dei accipit, et ingens lucrum reputat, quia nihil apud Deum, quantumlibet parvum pro Deo tamen passum, poterit sine merito transire.	“He is not truly patient who will only suffer as far as seemeth right to himself and from whom he pleaseth. But the truly patient man considereth not by what man he is tried, whether by one above him, or by an equal or inferior, whether by a good and holy man, or a perverse and unworthy; but indifferently from every creature, whatsoever or how often soever adversity happeneth to him, he gratefully accepteth all from the hand of God and counteth it great gain: for with God nothing which is borne for His sake, however small, shall lose its reward.
322	3	III.99	99	Esto igitur expeditus ad pugnam, si vis habere victoriam. Sine certamine non potes venire ad patientiæ coronam; si pati non vis, recusas coronari. Si autem coronari desideras, certa viriliter, sustine patienter. Sine labore non tenditur ad requiem, nec sine pugna pervenitur ad victoriam.	“Be thou therefore ready for the fight if thou wilt have the victory. Without striving thou canst not win the crown of patience; if thou wilt not suffer thou refusest to be crowned. But if thou desirest to be crowned, strive manfully, endure patiently. Without labour thou drawest not near to rest, nor without fighting comest thou to victory.”
323	3	III.100	100	Fac mihi possibile, Domine, per gratiam, quod mihi impossibiel videtur per naturam. Tu scis quod modicum possum pati, et quod cito dejicior, levi exsurgente adversitate. Efficiatur mihi quælibet exercitatio tribulationis, pro nomine tuo amabilis, et acceptabilis: nam pati et vexari pro te valde salubre est animæ meæ.	Make possible to me, O Lord, by grace what seemeth impossible to me by nature. Thou knowest how little I am able to bear, and how quickly I am cast down when a like adversity riseth up against me. Whatsoever trial of tribulation may come to me, may it become unto me pleasing and acceptable, for to suffer and be vexed for Thy sake is exceeding healthful to the soul.
324	3	III.101	101	De confessione propriæ infirmitatis, et hujus vitæ miseriis.	XX Of confession of our infirmity and of the miseries of this life
325	3	III.102	102	Confiteor adversum me injustitiam meam; confitebor tibi, Domini, infirmitatem meam. Sæpe parva res est quæ dejicit et contristat. Præpono me firmiter acturum, sed cum modica tentatio venerit, magis mihi sit angustia. Valde vilis quandoque res est, unde gravis tentatio provenit; dum puto me aliquantulum tutum, cum non sentio, invenio me nonnunquam pæne devictum ex levi flatu.	I will acknowledge my sin unto Thee; I will confess to Thee, Lord, my infirmity. It is often a small thing which casteth me down and maketh me sad. I resolve that I will act bravely, but when a little temptation cometh, immediately I am in a great strait. Wonderfully small sometimes is the matter whence a grievous temptation cometh, and whilst I imagine myself safe for a little space; when I am not considering, I find myself often almost overcome by a little puff of wind.
326	3	III.103	103	Vide ergo, Domine, humilitatem meam, et fragilitatem tibi undique notam. Miserere mei, eteripe me de luto, ut non infigar, non permaneam devictus usquequaque. Hoc est quod me frequenter reverberat, et coram te confundit, quod tam labilis sum, et infirmus ad resistendum passionibus, et si non omnino ad consensionem, tamen mihi etiam molesta et gravis est earum infectatio, et tædet valde sic quotidie vivere in lite. Exhinc nota sit mihi infirmitas mea, quia multo facilius irrunt abominandæ semper phantasiæ, quam discedunt.	Behold, therefore, O Lord, my humility and my frailty, which is altogether known to Thee. Be merciful unto me, and draw me out of the mire that I sink not , lest I ever remain cast down. This is what frequently throweth me backward and confoundeth me before Thee, that I am so liable to fall, so weak to resist my passions. And though their assault is not altogether according to my will, it is violent and grievous, and it altogether wearieth me to live thus daily in conflict. Herein is my infirmity made known to me, that hateful fancies always rush in far more easily than they depart.
327	3	III.104	104	Utinam, fortissime Deus Israel, zelator animarum fidelium, respicias servi tui laborem et dolorem, adsistasque illi in omnibus ad quæcumque perrexerit. Robora me cælesti fortitudine, neque vetus homo, misera caro spiritui necdum bene subjecta valeat dominari, adversus quam certare oportebit, quamdiu spiratur in hac vita miserrima. Heu, qualis est hæc vita? Ubi non desunt tribulationes, et miseriæ; ubi plena laqueis, et hostibus sunt omnia. Nam una tribulatione seu tentatione recedente, alia accedit, sed et adhuc priore durante conflictu aliæ plures superveniunt et insperatæ.	Oh that Thou, most mighty God of Israel, Lover of all faithful souls, wouldst look upon the labour and sorrow of Thy servant, and give him help in all things whereunto he striveth. Strengthen me with heavenly fortitude, lest the old man, this miserable flesh, not being yet fully subdued to the spirit, prevail to rule over me; against which I ought to strive so long as I remain in this most miserable life. Oh what a life is this, where tribulations and miseries cease not, where all things are full of snares and of enemies, for when one tribulation or temptation goeth, another cometh, yea, while the former conflict is yet raging others come more in number and unexpected.
328	3	III.105	105	Et quomodo potest amari vita hominis habens tantas amaritudines, et tot subjecta calamitatibus et miseriis? Quomodo etiam dicitur vita tot generans mortes et pestes? Et tamen amatur, et delectari in ea quæritur a multis. Reprehenditur frequenter mundus tanquam fallax sit, et vanus, nec tamen facile relinquitur, cum concupiscentiæ carnis dominantur. Sed alia trahunt ad amandum, alia ad contemnendum, alia ad amorem mundi,carnis desiderium, desiderium oculorum et superbia vitæ;sed pœnæ et miseriæ sequentes ea odium mundi pariunt et tædiunt.	And how can the life of man be loved, seeing that it hath so many bitter things, that it is subjected to so many calamities and miseries. How can it be even called life, when it produces so many deaths and plagues? The world is often reproached because it is deceitful and vain, yet notwithstanding it is not easily given up, because the lusts of the flesh have too much rule over it. Some draw us to love, some to hate. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, these draw to love of the world; but the punishments and miseries which righteously follow these things, bring forth hatred of the world and weariness.
329	3	III.106	106	Sed vincit, proh dolor, delectatio prava mentem mundo deditam, etesse sub sentibus delicias reputat, quia Dei suavitatem, et internam virtutis amœnitatem nec vidit nec gustavit. Qui qutem mundum perfecte contemnunt, et Deo vivere sub sancta disciplina student, isti dulcedinem divinam veris abrenuntiatoribus promissam non ignorant, et quam graviter mundus errat, et varie fallitur, vident.	But, alas! an evil desire conquereth a mind given to the world, and thinketh it happiness to be under the nettles because it savoureth not nor perceiveth the sweetness of God nor the inward gracefulness of virtue. But they who perfectly despise the world and strive to live unto God in holy discipline, these are not ignorant of the divine sweetness promised to all who truly deny themselves and see clearly how grievously the world erreth, and in how many ways it is deceived.
330	3	III.107	107	Quod in Deo super omnia bona et dona requiescendum est.	HAPTER XXI That we must rest in God above all goods and gifts
331	3	III.108	108	Super omnia et in omnibus requiesces, anima mea, in Domino semper, quia ipse est Sanctorum æterna requies. Da mihi, dulcissime et amantissime Jesus, in te super omnem salutem, et pulchritudinem, super omnem gloriam et honorem, super omnem potentiam et dignitatem, super omnem scientiam et subtilitatem, et super omnes divitias et artes, super omnem lætitiam et exultationem, super omnem famam et laudem, super omnem suavitatem, et consolationem, super omnem spem et promissionem, super omne meritum et desiderium, super omnia dona et munera quæ potest dare et infundere, super omne gaudium et jubilationem, quam potest mens capere et sentire. Denique super omnes Angelos et Archangelos, et super omnem exercitum cæli et super omnia visibilia et invisibilia, et super omne, Deus meus, quod tu, non es: quia tu, Deus meus, super omnia optimus es.	Above all things and in all things thou shalt rest alway in the Lord, O my soul, for he himself is the eternal rest of the saints. Grant me, most sweet and loving Jesus, to rest in Thee above every creature, above all health and beauty, above all glory and honour, above all power and dignity, above all knowledge and skilfulness, above all riches and arts, above all joy and exultation, above all fame and praise, above all sweetness and consolation, above all hope and promise, above all merit and desire, above all gifts and rewards which Thou canst give and pour forth, above all joy and jubilation which the mind is able to receive and feel; in a word, above Angels and Archangels and all the army of heaven, above all things visible and invisible, and above everything which Thou, O my God, art not.
332	3	III.109	109	Tu solus altissimus, tu solus potentissimus, tu solus sufficientissimus et plenissimus, tu solus suavissimus et solatiosissimus, tu solus pulcherrimus et amantissimus, tu solus nobilissimus et gloriosissimus super omnia; in quo bona cuncta simul perfecta sunt, fuerunt et erunt. Atque ideo minus est et insufficiens quidquid præter te ipsum mihi donas, et de te ipso revelas, vel promittis, te non viso nec plene adepto: quoniam quidem non potest cor meum veraciter requiescere, nec totaliter contentari, nisi in te requiescat, et omnia dona omnemque creaturam transcendat.	For Thou, O Lord, my God, art best above all things; Thou only art the Most High, Thou only the Almighty, Thou only the All-sufficient, and the Fulness of all things; Thou only the All-delightsome and the All-comforting; Thou alone the altogether lovely and altogether loving; Thou alone the Most Exalted and Most Glorious above all things; in Whom all things are, and were, and ever shall be, altogether and all-perfect. And thus it falleth short and is insufficient whatsoever Thou givest to me without Thyself or whatsoever Thou revealest or dost promise concerning Thyself, whilst Thou art not seen or fully possessed: since verily my heart cannot truly rest nor be entirely content, except it rest in Thee, and go beyond all gifts and every creature.
333	3	III.110	110	O, mi dilectissime sponse Jesu Christe, amator purissime, dominator universæ creaturæ, quis mihi det pennas veræ libertatis, ad volandum et pausandum in te? O, quando ad plenum dabitur vacare mihi, et videre quam suavis es, Domine Deus meus? Quando ad plenum recolligam me in te, ut præ amore tuo non sentiam me, sed te solum supra omnem sensum et modum in modo non omnibus noto? Nunc autem frequenter gemo, et infelicitatem meam cum dolore porto, quia multa mala in hac valle miseriarum occurrunt, quæ me sæpius conturbant, et contristant et obnubilant, sæpius impediunt, et distrahunt, alliciunt et implicant, ne liberum accessum habeam ad te, et ne jucundis fruar amplexibus, præsto semper cum beatis spiritibus. Moveat te suspirium meum, et desolatio multiplex in terra.	O my most beloved Spouse, Jesus Christ, most holy lover of my soul, Ruler of this whole Creation, who shall give me the wings of true liberty, that I may flee to Thee and find rest? Oh when shall it be given me to be open to receive Thee to the full, and to see how sweet Thou art, O Lord my God? When shall I collect myself altogether in Thee, that because of Thy love I may not feel myself at all, but may know Thee only above every sense and measure, in measure not known to others. But now I ofttimes groan, and bear my sad estate with sorrow; because many evils befall me in this vale of miseries which continually disturb and fill me with sorrow, and encloud me, continually hinder and fill me with care, allure and entangle me, that I cannot have free access to Thee, nor enjoy that sweet intercourse which is always near at hand to the blessed spirits. Let my deep sighing come before Thee, and my manifold desolation on the earth.
334	3	III.111	111	O, Jesu splendor æternæ gloriæ, solamen peregrinationis animæ meæ, apud te est os meum sine voce, et silentium meum loquitur tibi. Usquequo tardat Deus meus venire? Veniat ad me pauperculum suum, et lætum faciat, mittat manum suam, et miserum eripiat de omni angustia. Veni, veni, quia nulla erit sine te quieta dies aut hora, quia tu lætitia mea, et sine te vacua est mensa mea. Miser sum, et quodammodo incarceratus, et compeditus ac gravatus, donec luce præsentiæ tuæ me reficias, ac libertati dones, et vultum amicabilem reddas ac demonstres.	O Jesus, Light of Eternal Glory, solace of the wandering soul, before Thee my mouth is without speech, and my silence speaketh to Thee. How long will my Lord delay to come unto me? Let Him come unto me, His poor and humble one, and make me glad. Let Him put forth His hand, and deliver His holy one from every snare. Come, Oh come; for without Thee shall be no joyful day or hour, for Thou art my joy, and without Thee is my table empty. I am miserable, and in a manner imprisoned and loaded with fetters, until Thou refresh me by the light of Thy presence, and give me liberty, and show Thy loving countenance.
335	3	III.112	112	Quærant alii pro te aliud quodcumque libuerit, et mihi aliud interim nihil placet, nec placebit, nisi Deus meus, spes mea, salus æterna. Non reticebo nec depræcari cessabo, donec gratia tua revertatur nihi, quia tu intus loquaris.	Let others seek some other thing instead of Thee, whatsoever it shall please them; but for my part nothing else pleaseth or shall please, save Thou, my God, my hope, my eternal salvation. I will not hold my peace, nor cease to implore, until Thy grace return, and until Thou speak to me within.
336	3	III.113	113	Ecce adsum, ecce ego ad te venio, quia invocasti me. Lacrymæ tuæ, et desiderium animæ tuæ, humiliatio tua, et contritio cordis inclinaverunt me, et adduxerunt ad te.	“Behold, here I am! Behold, I come to thee, for thou didst call Me. Thy tears and the longing of thy soul, thy humbleness and contrition of heart have inclined Me, and brought Me to thee.”
337	3	III.114	114	Et dixi: Domine, invocavi te, et desideravi te frui, paratus omnia respuere propter te: tu enim prior excitasti me, ut quærerem te; sis ergo benedictus, Domine, qui fecisti hanc bonitatem cum servo tuo, secundum multitudinem misericordiæ tuæ. Quid habet ultra dicere, Domine, servus tuus coram te, nisi ut humiliet se valde ante te, memor semper propriæ iniquitatis, et infirmitatis et vilitatis. Non enim est similis tui in cunctis mirabilibus cæli, et terræ. Sunt opera tua bona valde, Domine, judicia vera, et providentia tua reguntur universa. Laus ergo tibi et gloria, o Patris sapientia, te laudet et benedicat os meum, anima ma, et cuncta creata simul.	And I said Lord, I have called upon Thee, and I have longed to enjoy Thee, being ready to reject everything for Thy sake. For Thou didst first move me to seek Thee. Therefore, blessed be Thou, O Lord, who has wrought this good work upon Thy servant, according to the multitude of Thy mercy. What then hath Thy servant to say in Thy presence, save to humble himself greatly before Thee, being alway mindful of his own iniquity and vileness. For there is none like unto Thee in all marvels of heaven and earth. Excellent are Thy works, true are Thy judgments, and by Thy Providence are all things governed. Therefore praise and glory be unto Thee, O Wisdom of the Father, let my mouth and my soul and all created things praise and bless Thee together.
338	3	III.115	115	De recordatione multiplicium beneficiorum Dei.	XXII Of the recollection of God’s manifold benefits
339	3	III.116	116	Aperi, Domine, cor meum in lege tua, et in præceptis tuis doce me ambulare. Da mihi intelligere voluntatem tuam et cum magna reverentia ac diligenti consideratione beneficia tua, tam in generali, quam in particulari memorare tibi, ut hinc valeam gratias referre. Verum scio et confiteor, nec pro minimo puncto me posse debitas gratiarum laudes persolvere. Minor ego sum omnibus bonis mihi præstitis; et cum tuam nobilitatem attendo, deficit præ magnitudine illius spiritus meus.	Open, O Lord, my heart in Thy law, and teach me to walk in the way of Thy commandments. Grant me to understand Thy will and to be mindful of Thy benefits, both general and special, with great reverence and diligent meditation, that thus I may be able worthily to give Thee thanks. Yet I know and confess that I cannot render Thee due praises for the least of Thy mercies. I am less than the least of all the good things which Thou gavest me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit faileth because of the greatness thereof.
340	3	III.117	117	Omnia quæ in anima habemus et in corpore et quæcumque exterius vel interius naturaliter vel supernaturaliter possidemus, tua sunt beneficia, et beneficum pium, ac bonum commendant, a quo bona cunta accepimus. Et si alius plura alius pauciora accepit, omnia tamen tua sunt, nec minimum sine te haberi potest. Ille qui majora accepit, non potest merito suo gloriari, nec super alios extolli, nec minori insultare, quia ille major et melior est, qui sibi minus adscribit, et in regratiando humilior est atque devotior: et qui omnibus viliorem se esse esistimat, et indigniorem se judicat, aptior est ad percipiendum majora.	All things which we have in the soul and in the body, and whatsoever things we possess, whether outwardly or inwardly, naturally or supernaturally, are Thy good gifts, and prove Thee, from whom we have received them all, to be good, gentle, and kind. Although one receiveth many things, and another fewer, yet all are Thine, and without Thee not even the least thing can be possessed. He who hath received greater cannot boast that it is of his own merit, nor lift himself up above others, nor contemn those beneath him; for he is the greater and the better who ascribeth least to himself, and in giving thanks is the humbler and more devout; and he who holdeth himself to be viler than all, and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy, is the apter for receiving greater things.
341	3	III.118	118	Qui autem pauciora accepit, contristari non debet, nec indignanter ferre, neque ditiori invidere: sed te potius attendere, et tuam bonitatem maxime laudare, quod tam affluenter, tam gratis, tam libenter sine personarum acceptione tua munera largiris. Omnia ex te, et ideo omnibus es laudandus. Tu scis quid unicuique donari expediat, et cur iste minus et ille amplius habeat, non nostrum, sed tuum est discernere, aud quem singulorum definita sunt merita.	But he who hath received fewer gifts, ought not to be cast down, nor to take it amiss, nor to envy him who is richer; but rather ought he to look unto Thee, and to greatly extol Thy goodness, for Thou pourest forth Thy gifts so richly, so freely and largely, without respect of persons. All things come of Thee; therefore in all things shalt thou be praised. Thou knowest what is best to be given to each; and why this man hath less, and that more, is not for us but for Thee to understand, for unto Thee each man’s deservings are fully known.
342	3	III.119	119	Unde, Domine Deus, pro magno etiam reputo beneficio, non multa habere unde exterius et secundum homines laus et gloria appareat: ita ut quis considerata paupertate et vilitate personæ suæ, non modo gravitatem, aut tristitiam, vel dejectionem inde concipiat, sed potius consolationem, et hilaritatem magnam; quia tu, Deus, pauperes et humiles atque huic mundo despectos tibi elegisti in familiares et domesticos. Testes sunt ipsi Apostoli tui, quosprincipes super omnem terram constituisti. Fuerunt enim sine querela conversati in mundo, tam humiles quam simplices sine omni malitia et dolo, ut etiam pati contemelias gauderent pro nomine tuo, et quæ mundus abhorret, ipsi amplecterentur affectu magno.	Wherefore, O Lord God, I reckon it even a great benefit, not to have many things, whence praise and glory may appear outwardly, and after the thought of men. For so it is that he who considereth his own poverty and vileness, ought not only to draw therefrom no grief or sorrow, or sadness of spirit, but rather comfort and cheerfulness; because Thou, Lord, hast chosen the poor and humble, and those who are poor in this world, to be Thy friends and acquaintance. So give all Thine apostles witness whom Thou hast made princes in all lands. Yet they had their conversation in this world blameless, so humble and meek, without any malice or deceit, that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes for Thy Name’s sake, and what things the world hateth, they embraced with great joy.
343	3	III.120	120	Nihil ergo amatorem tuum, et cognitorem beneficiorum tuorum ita lætificare debet, sicut voluntas tua in eo, et beneplacitum æternæ dispositionis tuæ, de qua tantum contentari debet et consolari, ut ita libenter velit esse minimus, sicut aliquis optaret esse maximus, et ita pacificus et contentus in novissimo loco sicut in loco primo atque ita libenter despicabilis, et abjectus, nullius quoque nominis et famæ sicut cæteris honorabilior, et major in mundo. Nam voluntas tua et amor honoris tui, omnia excedere debet, et plus eum consolari, magisque placere, quam omnia beneficia sibi data vel danda.	Therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth Thee and knoweth Thy benefits, as Thy will in him, and the good pleasure of Thine eternal Providence, wherewith he ought to be so contented and comforted, that he would as willingly be the least as any other would be the greatest, as peaceable and contented in the lowest as in the highest place, and as willingly held of small and low account and of no name or reputation as to be more honourable and greater in the world than others. For Thy will and the love of Thine honour ought to go before all things, and to please and comfort him more, than all benefits that are given or may be given to himself.
344	3	III.121	121	De 4.or. magnam importantibus pacem.	XXIII Of four things which bring great peace
345	3	III.122	122	Fili, nunc decebo te viam pacis et veræ libertatis.	“My Son, now will I teach thee the way of peace and of true liberty.”
346	3	III.123	123	Fac, Domine, quod dicis, quia hoc mihi est gratum audire.	Do, O my Lord, as Thou sayest, for this is pleasing unto me to hear.
347	3	III.124	124	Stude, Fili, alterius potius facere voluntatem quam tuam. Elige semper minus quam plus habere. Quære semper inferiorem locum et omnibus subesse. Opta semper et ora, ut voluntas Dei integre in te fiat. Ecce talis homo ingreditur fines pacis et quietis.	“Strive, My Son, to do another’s will rather than thine own. Choose always to have less rather than more. Seek always after the lowest place, and to be subject to all. Wish always and pray that the will of God be fulfilled in thee. Behold, such a man as this entereth into the inheritance of peace and quietness.”
348	3	III.125	125	Domine, sermo tuus iste brevis multum continet perfectionis; parvus est dictu, sed plenus sensu et uber in fructu. Nam si posset a me fideliter custodiri, non deberet tam facilis in me turbatio origi. Nam quoties me impacatum sentio et gravatum, ab hac doctrina me recessisse invenio. Sed tu qui omnia potes, et animæ profectum semper diligis, adauge amjorem gratiam, ut posim tuum complere sermonem, et meam perficere salutem.	O my Lord, this Thy short discourse hath in itself much of perfectness. It is short in words but full of meaning, and abundant in fruit. For if it were possible that I should fully keep it, disturbance would not so easily arise within me. For as often as I feel myself disquieted and weighed down, I find myself to have gone back from this teaching. But Thou, Who art Almighty, and always lovest progress in the soul, vouchsafe more grace, that I may be enabled to fulfil Thy exhortation, and work out my salvation.
349	3	III.126	126	Oratio contra cogitationes malas.	A PRAYER AGAINST EVIL THOUGHTS
350	3	III.127	127	Domine Deus meus, ne elongeris a me; Deus meus, in auxilium meum respice:quoniam in me surrexerunt cogitationes vanæ et timores magni affligentes animam meam. Quomodo pertransibo illæsus? Quomodo perfringam eas?	O Lord my God, be not Thou far from me, my God, haste Thee to help me, for many thoughts and great fears have risen up against me, afflicting my soul. How shall I pass through them unhurt? how shall I break through them?
351	3	III.128	128	Ego, inquit,ante te ibo, et gloriosos terræ humiliabo;aperiam januam carceris, et arcana secretorum revelabo tibi.	“I,” saith He, “will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight.” I will open the prison doors, and reveal to thee the secret places.
352	3	III.129	129	Fac, Domine, ut loqueris, et fugiant a facie tua omnes iniquæ cogitationes. Hæc est spes et unica consolatio mea, ad te in omni tribulatione confugere, tibi confidere, ex intimo invocare, et patienter consolationem tuam exspectare.	Do, Lord, as Thou sayest; and let all evil thoughts fly away before Thy face. This is my hope and my only comfort, to fly unto Thee in all tribulation, to hope in Thee, to call upon Thee from my heart and patiently wait for Thy loving kindness.
353	3	III.130	130	Oratio pro illuminatione mentis.	A PRAYER FOR ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE MIND
354	3	III.131	131	Clarifica me, bone Jesu, claritate æterni lumnis. Educ de habitaculo cordis mei tenebras universas. Cohibe evagationes multas et elide vim facientes tentationes. Pugna pro me fortiter, et expugna malas bestias, concupiscentias dico illecebrosas,ut fiat pax in virtute tua et abundantialaudis tuæ resonet in aula sancta, hoc est in conscientia pura. Impera ventis et tempestatibus; dic, mari quiesce; dic Aquiloni, ne flaveris: et erit tranquillitas magna.	Enlighten me, Blessed Jesus, with the brightness of Thy inner light, and cast forth all darkness from the habitation of my heart. Restrain my many wandering thoughts, and carry away the temptations which strive to do me hurt. Fight Thou mightily for me, and drive forth the evil beasts, so call I alluring lusts, that peace may be within Thy walls and plenteousness of praise within Thy palaces, even in my pure conscience. Command Thou the winds and the storms, say unto the sea, “Be still,” say unto the stormy wind, “Hold thy peace,” so shall there be a great calm.
355	3	III.132	132	Emitte lucem tuam et veritatem,ut luceant super terram, quia terra sum inanis et vacua, donec illumines me. Effunde gratiam tuam desuper, perfunde cor meum gratia cælesti, ministra devotionis aquas ad irrigandum faciem terræ, ad producendum fructum bonum et optimum. Eleva mentem pressam mole peccatorum et ad cælestia totum desiderium meum suspende: ut gustata suavitate supernæ felicitatis pigeat de terrenis cogitare.	Oh send forth Thy light and Thy truth, that they may shine upon the earth; for I am but earth without form and void until Thou give me light. Pour forth Thy grace from above; water my heart with the dew of heaven; give the waters of devotion to water the face of the earth, and cause it to bring forth good and perfect fruit. Lift up my mind which is oppressed with the weight of sins, and raise my whole desire to heavenly things; that having tasted the sweetness of the happiness which is from above, it may take no pleasure in thinking of things of earth.
356	3	III.133	133	Rape me et eripe me ab omni creaturarum indurabili consolatione, quia nulla res creata appetitum meum plenarie valet quietare et consolari. Junge me tibi inseparabili dilectionis vinculo, quoniam tu solus sufficis amanti et absque te frivola sunt universa.	Draw me and deliver me from every unstable comfort of creatures, for no created thing is able to satisfy my desire and to give me comfort. Join me to Thyself by the inseparable bond of love, for Thou alone art sufficient to him that loveth Thee, and without Thee all things are vain toys.
357	3	III.134	134	Chap. 24. De evitatione curiosæ inquisitionis super alterius vita.	XXIV Of avoiding of curious inquiry into the life of another
358	3	III.135	135	Fili, noli esse curiosus nec vacuas gerere sollicitudines.Quid hocvel illudad te? Tu me sequere.Quid enim ad te, utrum ille sit talis, vel talis, aut iste sic agit, vel loquitur? Tu non indiges respondere pro aliis, sed pro te ipso rationem reddas: quid ergo te implicas? Ecce ego omnes cognosco, et cuncta, quæ fiunt sub sole, video, et scio qualiter cum unoquoque sit, quod cogitet, quid velit, et ad quem finem tendat ejus intentio. Mihi igitur committenda sunt omnia; tu vero serva te in bona pace, et dimitte agitantem agitare quantum voluerit. Veniet super eum quidquid fecerit vel dixerit, quia me fallere non potest.	1 “My Son, be not curious, nor trouble thyself with vain cares. What is that to thee? Follow thou Me. For what is it to thee whether a man be this or that, or say or do thus or thus? Thou hast no need to answer for others, but thou must give an answer for thyself. Why therefore dost thou entangle thyself? Behold, I know all men, and I behold all things which are done under the sun; and I know how it standeth with each one, what he thinketh, what he willeth, and to what end his thoughts reach. All things therefore are to be committed to Me; watch thou thyself in godly peace, and leave him who is unquiet to be unquiet as he will. Whatsoever he shall do or say, shall come unto him, for he cannot deceive Me.
359	3	III.136	136	Non sit tibi curæ de magni nominis umbra, non de multorum familiaritate, nec de privata hominum dilectione: ista enim generant distractiones, et magnas in corde obscuritates. Libenter tibi loquerer Verbum meum, et abscondita revelarem, si adventum meum diligenter observares, et ostium cordis mihi aperires. Esto prudens, et vigila in orationibus et humilia te in omnibus.	“Trouble not thyself about the shadow of a great name, nor about the friendship of many, nor about the love of men towards thee. For these things beget distraction and great sorrows of heart. My word should speak freely unto thee, and I would reveal secrets, if only thou didst diligently look for My appearing, and didst open unto Me the gates of thy heart. Be sober and watch unto prayer,and humble thyself in all things.”
360	3	III.137	137	In quibus firma pax cordis, et verus profectus consistit.	XXV Wherein firm peace of heart and true profit consist
361	3	III.138	138	Fili, ego locutus sum:Pacem relinquo vobis, pacem meam do vobis; non quomodo hic mundus dat ego do vobis.Pacem omnes desiderant: sed quæ ad veram pacem pertinent, non omnes curant. Pax mea cum humilibus et mansuetis corde, pax tua erit in multa patientia. Si me audieris, et vocem meam secutus fueris, poteris multa pace frui. Quid igitur faciam in omni re? Attende tibi quid facias et quid dicas et omnem intentionem tuam ad hoc dirige, ut mihi soli placeas, et extra me nihil cupias, vel quæras. Sed et de aliorum dictis vel factis nil temere judices, nec cum rebus tibi non commissis te implices, et poterit fieri ut parum vel raro turberis.	“My Son, I have said, Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you. All men desire peace, but all do not care for the things which belong unto true peace. My peace is with the humble and lowly in heart. Thy peace shall be in much patience. If thou heardest Me, and didst follow My voice, thou shouldest enjoy much peace.” What then shall I do, Lord? “In everything take heed to thyself what thou doest, and what thou sayest; and direct all thy purpose to this, that thou please Me alone, and desire or seek nothing apart from Me. But, moreover, judge nothing rashly concerning the words or deeds of others, nor meddle with matters which are not committed to thee; and it may be that thou shalt be disturbed little or rarely.
362	3	III.139	139	Nunquam autem sentire aliquam turbationem, nec pati aliquam cordis vel corporis molestiam non est præsentis temporis, sed status æternæ quietis. Non ergo exstimes te veram pacem invenisse, si nullam senseris gravitatem, nec tunc totum esse bonum, si neminem pateris adversarium, nec hoc esse perfectum, si cuncta fuerint secundum tuum affectum. Neque tunc magni aliquid te reputes aut specialiter dilectum existimes, si in magna fueris devotione aut dulcedine: quia in istis non congnoscitur verus amator virtutis, nec in istis consistit profectus, et perfictio hominis.	Yet never to feel any disquiet, nor to suffer any pain of heart or body, this belongeth not to the present life, but is the state of eternal rest. Therefore count not thyself to have found true peace, if thou hast felt no grief; nor that then all is well if thou hast no adversary; nor that this is perfect if all things fall out according to thy desire. Nor then reckon thyself to be anything great, or think that thou art specially beloved, if thou art in a state of great fervour and sweetness of spirit; for not by these things is the true lover of virtue known, nor in them doth the profit and perfection of man consist.”
363	3	III.140	140	In quo ergo, Domine? In offerendo te ex toto corde tuo voluntati divinæ, non quærendo quæ tua sunt, nec in parvo nec in magno, nec in tempore nec in æternitate, ita ut una æquali facie in gratiarum actione permaneas inter prospera et contraria omnia æqua lance pensando. Si fueris tam fortis et longanimis in spe, ut subtracta interiori consolatione etiam ad ampliora sustinenda cor tuum præparaveris, nec te justificaveris et sanctum laudaveris: tunc in vera et recta via pacis ambulas, et spes, indubitata erit, quod rursus in jubilo faciem meam sis visurus. Quod si ad plenum tui ipsius contemptum peveneris, scito quod tunc abundantia pacis perfrueris secundum possibilitatem tui incolatus.	In what then, Lord? “In offering thyself with all thy heart to the Divine Will, in not seeking the things which are thine own, whether great or small, whether temporal or eternal; so that thou remain with the same steady countenance in giving of thanks between prosperity and adversity, weighing all things in an equal balance. If thou be so brave and long-suffering in hope that when inward comfort is taken from thee, thou even prepare thy heart for the more endurance, and justify not thyself, as though thou oughtest not to suffer these heavy things, but dost justify Me in all things that I appoint, and dost bless My Holy Name, then dost thou walk in the true and right way of peace, and shalt have a sure hope that thou shalt again behold My face with joy. For if thou come to an utter contempt of thyself, know that then thou shalt enjoy abundance of peace, as much as is possible where thou art but a wayfaring man.”
364	3	III.141	141	De eminentia liberæ mentis quam supplex oratio magis meretur quam lectio.	XXVI Of the exaltation of a free spirit, which humble prayer more deserveth than doth frequent reading
365	3	III.142	142	Domine, hoc opus est perfecti viri, nunquam ab intentione cælestium animum relaxare et inter multas curas quasi sine cura transire, non more torpentis, sed prærogativa quadam liberæ mentis, nulli creaturæ inordinata affectione adhærando.	Lord, this is the work of a perfect man, never to slacken his mind from attention to heavenly things, and among many cares to pass along as it were without care, not after the manner of one indifferent, but rather with the privilege of a free mind, cleaving to no creature with inordinate affection.
366	3	III.143	143	Obsecro te, piissime Domine Deus meus, præserva me a curis hujus vitæ, ne nimis implicer a multis necessitatibus corporis, ne voluptate capiar ab universis animæ obstaculis, ne molestiis fractus dejiciar. Non dico ab his rebus, quas toto affectu ambit vanitas mundana, sed ab his miseriis, quæ animam servi tui communi maledicto mortalitatis pœnaliter gravant et retardant, ne in libertatem spiritus quoties libuerit valeat introire.	I beseech Thee, my most merciful Lord God, preserve me from the cares of this life, lest I become too much entangled; from many necessities of the body, lest I be taken captive by pleasure; from all obstacles of the spirit, lest I be broken and cast down with cares. I say not from those things which the vanity of the world goeth about after with all eagerness, but from those miseries, which by the universal curse of mortality weigh down and hold back the soul of thy servant in punishment, that it cannot enter into liberty of spirit, so often as it would.
367	3	III.144	144	O, Deus meus, dulcedo ineffabilis, verte mihi in amaritudinem omnem consolationem carnalem ab æternorum amore me abstrahentem, et ad se in intuitu cujusdam boni delectabilis præsentis male allicientem. Non me vincat, Deus meus, non me vincat caro et snaguis, non me decipiat mundus, ac brevis gloria ejus, non me suplantet diabolus et astutia illius. Da mihi fortitudinem resistendi, patientiam tolerandi, constantiam perseverandi. Da pro omnibus mundi consolationibus suavissimam spiritus tui unctionem, et pro carnali amoe tui nominis infunde amorem.	O my God, sweetness unspeakable, turn into bitterness all my fleshly consolation, which draweth me away from the love of eternal things, and wickedly allureth toward itself by setting before me some present delight. Let not, O my God, let not flesh and blood prevail over me, let not the world and its short glory deceive me, let not the devil and his craftiness supplant me. Give me courage to resist, patience to endure, constancy to persevere. Grant, in place of all consolations of the world, the most sweet unction of Thy Spirit, and in place of carnal love, pour into me the love of Thy Name.
368	3	III.145	145	Ecce cibus, potus, vestis ac cætera utensilia ad corporis sustentaculum pertenentia, serventi spiritui sunt onerosa. Tribue talibus fomentis temperate uti, non desiderio nimio implicari. Abjicere omnia non licet, quia natura sustentanda est; requirere auem superflua et quæ magis delectant, lex sancta prohibet: nam alias caro adversus spiritum insolesceret. Inter hæc quæso manus tua, Domine, me regat et doceat, ne quid nimium fiat.	Behold, food and drink and clothing, and all the other needs appertaining to the support of the body, are burdensome to the devout spirit. Grant that I may use such things with moderation, and that I be not entangled with inordinate affection for them. To cast away all these things is not lawful, because nature must be sustained, but to require superfluities and things which merely minister delight, the holy law forbiddeth; for otherwise the flesh would wax insolent against the spirit. In all these things, I beseech Thee, let Thy hand guide and teach me, that I in no way exceed.
369	3	III.146	146	Quod privatus amor a summo bono maxime retardat.	XXVII That personal love greatly hindereth from the highest good
370	3	III.147	147	Fili, oportet te dare totum pro toto, et nihil tui ipsius esse. Scito quod amor tui ipsius magis nocet tibi, quam aliqua res hujus mundi. Secundum amorem et affectum quem geris quælibet res plus vel minus adhæret. Si fuerit amor tuus purus et simplex et bene ordinatus, eris sine captivitate rerum. Noli concupiscere quod non licet habere; noli habere quod te potest impedire et libertate interiori privare. Mirum quod non ex toto fundo cordis te ipsum mihi committis cum omnibus quæ desiderare potes, vel habere.	“My Son, thou must give all for all, and be nothing of thine own. Know thou that the love of thyself is more hurtful to thee than anything in the world. According to the love and inclination which thou hast, everything more or less cleaveth to thee. If thy love be pure, sincere, well-regulated, thou shalt not be in captivity to anything. Do not covet what thou mayest not have; do not have what is able to hinder thee, and to rob thee of inward liberty. It is wonderful that thou committest not thyself to Me from the very bottom of thy heart, with all things which thou canst desire or have.
371	3	III.148	148	Quare vano mærore consumeris? cur superfluis curis fatigaris? Sta ad beneplacitum meum, et nullum patieris detrimentum. Si quæris hoc vel illud, et volueris esse ibi vel ibi propter tuum commodum et proprium beneplacitum magis habendum, nunquam eris in quietudine, nec liber a sollicitudine, quia in omni re reperietur aliquis defectus, et in omni loco erit qui adversetur.	“Why art thou consumed with vain sorrow? Why art thou wearied with superfluous cares? Stand thou by My good pleasure, and thou shalt suffer no loss. If thou seekest after this or that, and wilt be here or there, according to thine own advantage or the fulfilling of thine own pleasure, thou shalt never be in quiet, nor free from care, because in everything somewhat will be found lacking, and everywhere there will be somebody who opposeth thee.
372	3	III.149	149	Juvat ergo non quælibet res adepta, vel multiplicata exterius, sed potius contemta et decisa ex corde radicitus. Quod non tantum de censu æris, et divitiarum intelligat, sed de honoris etiam ambitu ac vanæ laudationis desiderio, quæ omnia transeunt cum mundo. Munit parum locus, si deest spiritus fervoris; nec diu stabit pax illa quæsita forinsecus, si vacat a vero fundamento status cordis: hoc est, nisi steteris in me, permutare te potes, sed non meliorare. Nam occasione orta et accepta invenies quod fugisti et amplius.	“Therefore it is not gaining or multiplying of this thing or that which advantageth thee, but rather the despising it and cutting it by the root out of thy heart; which thou must not only understand of money and riches, but of the desire after honour and vain praise, things which all pass away with the world. The place availeth little if the spirit of devotion is wanting; nor shall that peace stand long which is sought from abroad, if the state of thy heart is without the true foundation, that is, if it abide not in Me. Thou mayest change, but thou canst not better thyself; for when occasion ariseth and is accepted thou shalt find what thou didst fly from, yea more.”
373	3	III.150	150	Oratio pro purgatione cordis et cælesti sapientia.	A PRAYER FOR CLEANSING OF THE HEART AND FOR HEAVENLY WISDOM
374	3	III.151	151	Confirma me, Deus, per gratiam Sancti Spiritus; da mihi virtutem corroborari in interiori homine, et cor meum ab omni inutili sollicitudine et angore evacuare, nec variis desideriis trahi cujuscumque rei vilis, aut prætiosæ: sed omnia inspicere sicut transeuntia, et me pariter cum illis transiturum, quia nihil permanens sub sole, quia omnia vanitas et afflictio spiritus. O, quam sapiens qui ita considerat.	Strengthen me, O God, by the grace of Thy Holy Spirit. Give me virtue to be strengthened with might in the inner man, and to free my heart from all fruitless care and trouble, and that I be not drawn away by various desires after any things whatsoever, whether of little value or great, but that I may look upon all as passing away, and myself as passing away with them; because there is no profit under the sun, and all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Oh how wise is he that considereth thus!
375	3	III.152	152	Da mihi, Domine, cælestem sapientiam, ut discam te super omnia quærere, et invenire, super omnia sapere et diligere, et cætera secundum ordinem sapientiæ tuæ, prout sunt, intelligere. Da prudenter declinare blandientem et patienter ferre adversantem, quia hæc magna sapientia, omni vento non moveri verborum, nec aurem male blandienti præbere: sic enim incepta pergitur via secure.	Give me, O Lord, heavenly wisdom, that I may learn to seek Thee above all things and to find Thee; to relish Thee above all things and to love Thee; and to understand all other things, even as they are, according to the order of Thy wisdom. Grant me prudently to avoid the flatterer, and patiently to bear with him that opposeth me; for this is great wisdom, not to be carried by every wind of words, nor to give ear to the wicked flattering Siren; for thus do we go safely on in the way we have begun.
376	3	III.153	153	Contra linguas obtrectatorum.	XXVIII Against the tongues of detractors
377	3	III.154	154	Fili, non ægre feras, si quidam de te male senserint, et dixerint quod non libenter audias. Tu deteriora de te ipso sentire debes, et neminem inferiorem te credere. Si ambulas ab intra, non multum ponderabis volantia verba ab extra. Est non parva prudentia silere in tempore malo, et introrsus ad me converti, nec humano judicio disturbari.	“My Son, take it not sadly to heart, if any think ill of thee, and say of thee what thou art unwilling to hear. Thou oughtest to think worse of thyself, and to believe no man weaker than thyself. If thou walkest inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying words above their value. It is no small prudence to keep silence in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto Me, and not to be troubled by human judgment.
378	3	III.155	155	Non sit pax tua in ore hominum; sive enim bene sive male interpretati fuerint, non es alter homo. Ubi est vera pax et vera gloria? Nonne in me? Et qui non appetit hominibus placere, nec displicere timet, multa fruetur pace. Ex inordinato amore, et vano timore, oritur omnis inquietudo cordis et distractio sensuum.	“Let not thy peace depend upon the word of men; for whether they judge well or ill of thee, thou art not therefore any other man than thyself. Where is true peace or true glory? Is it not in Me? And he who seeketh not to please men, nor feareth to displease, shall enjoy abundant peace. From inordinate love and vain fear ariseth all disquietude of heart, and all distraction of the senses.”
379	3	III.156	156	Qualiter instante tribulatione Deus invocandus est.	XXIX How when tribulation cometh we must call upon and bless God
380	3	III.157	157	Sit nomen tuum, Domine, benedictum in sæcula, qui voluisti hanc tentationem et tribulationem venire super me. Non possum eam effugere, sed necesse habeo ad te confugere, ut me adjuves et in bonum mihi convertas. Domine modo sum in tribulatione, et non est cordi meo bene, sed multum vexor a præsenti passione. Et nunc, Pater dilecte, quid dicam? Deprehensus sum inter angustias. Salvifica me in hac hora. Sed propterea veni in hanc horam, ut tu clarificeris, cum fuero valde humiliatus, et per te liberatus. Complaceat tibi, Domine, ut eruas me. Nam quid ego pauper agere possum? et quo ibo sine te? Da patientiam, Domine, etiam hac vice. Adjuva me, Deus meus, et non timebo quantumcumque gravatus fuero.	Blessed be thy name, O Lord, for evermore, who hast willed this temptation and trouble to come upon me. I cannot escape it, but have need to flee unto Thee, that Thou mayest succour me and turn it unto me for good. Lord, now am I in tribulation, and it is not well within my heart, but I am sore vexed by the suffering which lieth upon me. And now, O dear Father, what shall I say? I am taken among the snares. Save me from this hour, but for this cause came I unto this hour, that Thou mightest be glorified when I am deeply humbled and am delivered through Thee. Let it be Thy pleasure to deliver me; for what can I do who am poor, and without Thee whither shall I go? Give patience this time also. Help me, O Lord my God, and I will not fear how much soever I be weighed down.
381	3	III.158	158	Et nunc inter hæc quid dicam? Domine, fiat voluntas tua. Ego bene merui tribulari et gravari. Oportet itaque ut sustineam, et utinam patienter, donec transeat tempestas, et melius fiat. Potens est autem omniotens manus tua, etiam hanc tentationem a me auferre, et ejus impetum mitigare, ne penitus succumbam, quemadmodum et prius sæpe egisti mecum. Deus meus misericordia mea. Et quanto mihi difficuliu, tanto tibi facilior esthæc mutatio dexteræ Excelsi.	And now amid these things what shall I say? Lord, Thy will be done. I have well deserved to be troubled and weighed down. Therefore I ought to bear, would that it be with patience, until the tempest be overpast and comfort return. Yet is Thine omnipotent arm able also to take this temptation away from me, and to lessen its power that I fall not utterly under it, even as many a time past thou has helped me, O God, my merciful God. And as much as this deliverance is difficult to me, so much is it easy to Thee, O right hand of the most Highest.
382	3	III.159	159	De divino auxilio petendo, et confidentia recuperandæ gratiæ.	XXX Of seeking divine help, and the confidence of obtaining grace
383	3	III.160	160	Fili, egoDominus confortans in die tribulatoinis.Veni ad me, cum tibi non fueris bene. Hoc est quod maxime impedit consolationem cælestem, quia tardius convertis te ad orationem. Nam antequam me intente roges, me, multa interim solatia quæris et recreas te in externis. Ideoque fit ut parum omnia prosint, donec advertas, quia sum ego qui curo sperantes in me; nec est extra me valens consilium neque utile, sed neque durabile remedium. Sed jam reassumto spiritu post tempestatem reconvalesce in lucem miserationum mearum, quia prope sum, dicit Dominus, ut restaruem in universa, non solum integre, sed et abundanter et cumulate.	“My Son, I the Lord am a stronghold in the day of trouble.Come unto Me, when it is not well with thee. “This it is which chiefly hindereth heavenly consolation, that thou too slowly betakest thyself unto prayer. For before thou earnestly seekest unto Me, thou dost first seek after many means of comfort, and refresheth thyself in outward things: so it cometh to pass that all things profit thee but little until thou learn that it is I who deliver those who trust in Me; neither beside Me is there any strong help, nor profitable counsel, nor enduring remedy. But now, recovering courage after the tempest, grow thou strong in the light of My mercies, for I am nigh, saith the Lord, that I may restore all things not only as they were at the first, but also abundantly and one upon another.
384	3	III.161	161	Numquid mihi quidquam difficile est? aut similis ero dicenti et non facienti? Ubi est fides tua? Sta firmiter et perseveranter. Esto longanimis et vir fortis. Veniet tibi consolatio in tempore suo. Exspecta me, exspecta: veniam et curabo te. Tentatio est quæ te vexat, et formido vana quæ te exterret. Quid importat sollicitudo de futuris contingentibus, nisi ut tristitiam super tristitiam habeas?Sufficit diei malitia sua.Vanum est et inutile de futuris conturbari vel gratulari, quæ forte nunquam evenient.	“For is anything too hard for Me, or shall I be like unto one who saith and doeth not? Where is thy faith? Stand fast and with perseverance. Be long-suffering and strong. Consolation will come unto thee in its due season. Wait for Me; yea, wait; I will come and heal thee. It is temptation which vexeth thee, and a vain fear which terrifieth thee. What doth care about future events bring thee, save sorrow upon sorrow? Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. It is vain and useless to be disturbed or lifted up about future things which perhaps will never come.
385	3	III.162	162	Sed humanum est hujusmodi imaginationibus illudi, et parvi est adhuc animi signum, tam leviter trahi a suggestione inimici. Ipse enim non curat an veris an falsis illudat et decipiat et utrum præsentium amore an futurorum formidine prosternat. Non ergo turbetur cor tuum neque formidet; crede in me, et in misericordia mea habeto fiduciam. Quando tu te elongatum exstimas a me, sæpe sum propinquior. Quando exstimas te totum perditum, tunc sæpe magis merendi instat lucrum. Non est totum perditum, quando res accidit in contrarium. Non debes judicare secundum præsens sentire, nec sic gravitati alicui undecumque venienti adhærere et accipere, tamquam omnis spes sit ablata emergendi.	“But it is the nature of man to be deceived by fancies of this sort, and it is a sign of a mind which is still weak to be so easily drawn away at the suggestion of the enemy. For he careth not whether he deceive and beguile by true means or false; whether he throw thee down by the love of the present or fear of the future. Therefore let not thy heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Believe in Me, and put thy trust in My mercy. When thou thinkest thyself far removed from Me, I am often the nearer. When thou reckonest that almost all is lost, then often is greater opportunity of gain at hand. All is not lost when something goeth contrary to thy wishes. Thou oughtest not to judge according to present feeling, nor so to take or give way to any grief which befalleth thee, as if all hope of escape were taken away.
386	3	III.163	163	Noli putare te relictum ex toto, quamvis ad tempus permiserim tibi aliquam tribulationem: sic enim transitur ad regnum cælorum. Et hoc sine dubio magis expedit tibi et cæteris servis meis, ut exercitemini a diversis, quam si cuncta ad libitum haberetis. Ego novi cogitationes absconditas: quia multum expedit pro salute tua, ut interdum sine sapore relinquaris, ne forte eleveris in bono successu, et tibi ipsi placere velis in eo quod non es. Quod dedi auferre possum et restituere, cum mihi placuerit.	“Think not thyself totally abandoned, although for the time I have sent to thee some tribulation, or have even withdrawn some cherished consolation; for this is the way to the Kingdom of Heaven. And without doubt it is better for thee and for all My other servants, that ye should be proved by adversities, than that ye should have all things as ye would. I know thy hidden thoughts: and that it is very needful for thy soul’s health that sometimes thou be left without relish, lest perchance thou be lifted up by prosperity, and desirous to please thyself in that which thou art not. What I have given I am able to take away, and to restore again at My good pleasure.
387	3	III.164	164	Cum dedero, meum est; cum subtraxero, tuum non tuli: quia meum estomne datum optimum, et omne donum perfectum.Si dimisero tibi gravitatem, aut quamlibet contrarietatem, non indigneris, neque concidat cor tuum, quia ego cito sublevare possum, et omne onus in gaudium transmutare. Verumtamen justus sum et commendabilis multum, cum sic facio tecum.	“When I shall have given, it is Mine; when I shall have taken away, I have not taken what is thine; for every good gift and every perfect gift is from me. If I shall have sent upon thee grief or any vexation, be not angry, nor let thy heart be sad; I am able quickly to lift thee up and to change every burden into joy. But I am just and greatly to be praised, when I do thus unto thee.
388	3	III.165	165	Si recte sapis et in veritate aspicis, nunquam debes propter adversa tam dejecte contristari, sed magis gaudere, et gratias agere. Immo hoc unicum reputare gaudium, quod affligens te doloribus, non parco tibi.Sicut dilexet me Pater, et ego diligo vosdixi dilectis discipulis meis, quos utique non misi ad gaudia temporalia, sed ad magna certamina; non ad honores, sed ad despectiones; non ad otium, sed ad labores; non ad requiem, sed ad afferendum fructum multum in patientia. Horum memento, fili me, verborum.	“If thou rightly consider, and look upon it with truth, thou oughtest never to be so sadly cast down because of adversity, but rather shouldst rejoice and give thanks; yea, verily to count it the highest joy that I afflict thee with sorrows and spare thee not. As My Father hath loved Me, so love I you; thus have I spoken unto My beloved disciples: whom I sent forth not unto worldly joys, but to great strivings; not unto honours, but unto contempt; not unto ease, but to labours; not unto rest, but to bring forth much fruit with patience. My son, remember these words.”
389	3	III.166	166	De neglectu omnis creaturæ, ut Creator possit inveniri.	XXXI Of the neglect of every creature, that the Creator may be found
390	3	III.167	167	Domine mi, adhuc indegeo majori gratia, si debeo illuc pervenire, ubi nemo me poterit, nec ulla creatura impedire. Nam quamdiu res aliqua me retinet, non possum libere ad te volare. Cupiebat libere volare qui dicebat:Quis dabit mihi pennas sicut columbæ, et volabo, et requiescam?Quid simplici oculo quietius, et quid liberius nil desiderante in terris? Oportet igitur omnem pertransire creaturam, et se ipsum perfecte deserere ac in excessu mentis stare, et videre te omnium Conditorem cum creaturis nil simile habere. Et nisi quis ab omnibus creaturis fuerit expeditus, non poterit libere intendere divinis. Ideo enim pauci inveniuntur contemplativi, quia pauci sciunt se a perituris creaturis ad plenum sequestrari.	O Lord, I still need more grace, if I would arrive where neither man nor any other creature may hinder me. For so long as anything keepeth me back, I cannot freely fly unto Thee. He desired eagerly thus to fly, who cried, saying, Oh that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. What is more peaceful than the single eye? And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth? Therefore must a man rise above every creature, and perfectly forsake himself, and with abstracted mind to stand and behold that Thou, the Creator of all things, hast among Thy creatures nothing like unto Thyself. And except a man be freed from all creatures, he will not be able to reach freely after Divine things. Therefore few are found who give themselves to contemplation, because few know how to separate themselves entirely from perishing and created things.
391	3	III.168	168	Ad hoc magna requiritur gratia, quæ animam levet et supra semetipsam rapiat. Et nisi homo sit super se levatus in spiritu, et ab omnibus creaturis liberatus ac Deo totus unitus quidquid scit, quidquid etiam habet, non est magni ponderis, diu parvus erit. Et infra jacebit qui aliquid magni existimat nisi solum unum immensum bonum æternum. Et quidquid Deus non est, nihil est et pro nihilo computari debet. Est quippe magna differentia inter sapientiam illuminati et devoti viri, et scientiam litterati, et studiosi Clerici. Multo nobilior est illa doctrina quæ desursum ex divina influentia manat, quam quæ laboriose humano acquiritur ingenio.	For this much grace is necessary, which may lift up the soul and raise it above itself. And except a man be lifted up in the spirit, and freed from all creatures, and altogether united to God, whatsoever he knoweth, whatsoever even he hath, it mattereth but little. He who esteemeth anything great save the one only incomprehensible, eternal, good, shall long time be little and lie low. For whatsoever is not God is nothing, and ought to be counted for nothing. Great is the difference between a godly man, illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar learned in knowledge and given to books. Far nobler is that doctrine which floweth down from the divine fulness above, than that which is acquired laboriously by human study.
392	3	III.169	169	Plures reperiuntur contemplationem, desiderare, sed quæ ad eam requiruntur non student exercere. Est et magnum impedimentum quia in signis et rebus sensibilibus statur, et parum de perfecta mortificatione habetur. Nescio quid est, et quo spiritu ducimur et quid prætendimus qui spirituales dici videmur quod totum laborem et ampliorem sollicitudinem pro transitoriis et vilibus rebus agimus, et de interioribus nostris vix raro plene recollectis sensibus cogitamus.	Many are found who desire contemplation, but they do not strive to practice those things which are required thereunto. It is also a great impediment, that much is made of symbols and external signs, and too little of thorough mortification. I know not how it is, and by what spirit we are led, and what we who would be deemed spiritual are aiming at, that we give so great labour and so eager solicitude for transitory and worthless things, and scarcely ever gather our senses together to think at all of our inward condition.
393	3	III.170	170	Proh dolor, satim post modicam recollectionem foris erumpimus, nec opera nostra destricta examinatione trutinamus. Ubi jacent affectus nostri, non attendimus, et quam impura sint omnia nostra, non deploramus.Omnis quippe caro corruperate viam suam,et ideo sequebatur diluvium magnum. Cum ergo interior affectus noster corruptus sit, necesse est ut actio sequens index carentiæ interioris vigoris corrumpatur. Ex puro corde procedit fructus bonæ vitæ.	Ah, me! Forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of doors, and do not subject our actions to a strict examination. Where our affections are set we take no heed, and we weep not that all things belonging to us are so defiled. For because all flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, the great deluge came. Since therefore our inmost affections are very corrupt, it followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt, being the index of a deficient inward strength. Out of a pure heart proceedeth the fruit of good living.
394	3	III.171	171	Quantum quis fecerit non quæritur, sed ex quanta virtute agit, non tam studiose pensatur. Si fuerit fortis, dives, pulcher, habilis vel bonus scriptor, vel bonus cantor, aut bonus laborator, investigatur; sed quam pauper sit spiritu, quam patiens et mitis, quam devotus et internus, a multis tacetur. Natura exteriora hominis respicit: gratia ad interiora se convertit. Illa frequenter fallitur; ista in Deo sperat, ut non decipiatur.	We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue he acted, is not so narrowly considered. We ask if he be strong, rich, handsome, clever, whether he is a good writer, good singer, good workman; but how poor he may be in spirit, how patient and gentle, how devout and meditative, on these things many are silent. Nature looketh upon the outward appearance of a man, grace turneth its thought to the heart. The former frequently judgeth amiss; the latter trusteth in God, that it may not be deceived.
395	3	III.172	172	De abnegatione sui ipsius et abdicatione omnis cupiditatis.	XXXII Of self-denial and the casting away all selfishness
396	3	III.173	173	Fili, non potes perfecte possidere libertatem nisi totaliter abneges temetipsum. Compediti sunt omnes proprietarii et sui ipsius amatores, cupidi, curiosi, gyrovagi, quærentes semper curiosa et mollia, non quæ Jesu Christi: sed sæpe hoc fingentes et componentes hoc, quod non stabit. Peribit enim totum hoc quod non es ex Deo ortum. Tene breve et consummatum verbum: Dimitte omnia, et invenies omnia: dimitte cupidinem, et invenies requiem. Hoc mente pertracta et cum impleveris, omnia intelligis.	“My Son, thou canst not possess perfect liberty unless thou altogether deny thyself. All they are enslaved who are possessors of riches, they who love themselves, the selfish, the curious, the restless; those who ever seek after soft things, and not after the things of Jesus Christ; those who continually plan and devise that which will not stand. For whatsoever cometh not of God shall perish. Hold fast the short and complete saying, ‘Renounce all things, and thou shalt find all things; give up thy lust, and thou shalt find rest.’ Dwell upon this in thy mind, and when thou art full of it, thou shalt understand all things.”
397	3	III.174	174	Domine, hoc non est opus unius diei, nec ludus parvulorum: immo in hoc brevi conclluditur omnis perfectio Religioforum.	O Lord, this is not the work of a day, nor children’s play; verily in this short saying is enclosed all the perfection of the religious.
398	3	III.175	175	Fili, non debes averti, nec statim dejici audita via perfectorum, sed magis ad sublimiora provocari, et ad minus ad hoc ex desiderio suspirare. Utinam sic tecum esses, et ad hoc pervenisses, ut tui ipsius amator non esses, sed ad nutum meum pure stares, et ejus quem tibi præposui Patris: tunc mihi valde placeres, et tota vita tua cum gaudio et pace transiret. Habes adhuc multa ad relinquendum quæ nisi mihi ex integro resignaveris, non acquires quod postulas. Suadeo tibi emere a me aurum ignitum, ut locuples fias, idest sapientiam cælestem, omnia infima conculacantem. Postpone terrenam sapientiam omnem ac humanam complacentiam et propriam.	“My son, thou oughtest not to be turned aside, nor immediately cast down, because thou hast heard the way of the perfect. Rather oughtest thou to be provoked to higher aims, and at the least to long after the desire thereof. Oh that it were so with thee, and that thou hadst come to this, that thou wert not a lover of thine own self, but wert ready always to My nod, and to his whom I have placed over thee as thy father. Then shouldest thou please Me exceedingly, and all thy life should go on in joy and peace. Thou hast still many things to renounce, which if thou resign not utterly to Me, thou shalt not gain what thou seekest. I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, that is heavenly wisdom, which despiseth all base things. Put away from thee earthly wisdom, and all pleasure, whether common to men, or thine own.
399	3	III.176	176	Dixi tibi viliora emenda pro prætiosis, et altis rebus humanis. Nam vilis et parva, et pene oblivioni tradita videtur vere cælestis sapientia, non sapiens alta de se, nec magnificari quærens in terra. Quam multi ore tenus prædicant, sed vita longe dissentiunt: ipsa tamen est prætiosa margarita multis abscondita.	“I tell thee that thou must buy vile things with those which are costly and great in the esteem of men. For wonderfully vile and small, and almost given up to forgetfulness, doth true heavenly wisdom appear, which thinketh not high things of itself, nor seeketh to be magnified upon the earth; many honour it with their lips, but in heart are far from it; it is indeed the precious pearl, which is hidden from many.”
400	3	III.177	177	De instabilitate cordis et de intentione finali ad Deum habenda.	XXXIII Of instability of the heart, and of directing the aim towards God
401	3	III.178	178	Fili, noli credere affectui tuo, qui nunc est: cito mutabitur in aliud. Quamdiu nam vixeris, mutabilitati subjectus eris, etiam nolens: ut modo lætus, modo tristis, modo pacatus, modo turbatus, nunc devotus, nunc indevotus, nunc studiosus, nunc acidiosus, nunc gravi, nunc levis inveniaris. Sed stat super hæc mutabilia sapiens et bene doctus in spiritu, non attendens quid in se sentiat nec qua parte flet ventus instabilitatis, sed ut tota intentio mentis ejus ad debitum et ad optimum proficiat finem. Nam sic poterit unus et idem inconcussus manere, simplici intentionis oculo per tot varios eventus ad me imprætermisse directo.	“My Son, trust not thy feeling, for that which is now will be quickly changed into somewhat else. As long as thou livest thou art subject to change, howsoever unwilling; so that thou art found now joyful, now sad; now at peace, now disquieted; now devout, now indevout; now studious, now careless; now sad, now cheerful. But the wise man, and he who is truly learned in spirit, standeth above these changeable things, attentive not to what he may feel in himself, or from what quarter the wind may blow, but that the whole intent of his mind may carry him on to the due and much-desired end. For thus will he be able to remain one and the same and unshaken, the single eye of his desire being steadfastly fixed, through the manifold changes of the world, upon Me.
402	3	III.179	179	Quanto autem purior fuerit intentionis oculus, tanto constantius inter diversas itur procellas. Sed multis caligat oculos puræ intentionis. Respicit enim cito in aliquod delectabile quod occurrit et raro totus quis liber invenitur a nævo propriæ inquisitionis. Sic Judæi olim venerunt Bethaniam ad Martham et Mariam,non propter Jesum tantum, sed ut Lazarum viderent.Mundandus est ergo intentionis oculus, ut sit simplex et rectus atque ultra omnia varia media ad me dirigendus.	“But according as the eye of intention be the more pure, even so will a man make his way steadfastly through the manifold storms. But in many the eye of pure intention waxeth dim; for it quickly resteth itself upon anything pleasant which occurreth, and rarely is any man found altogether free from the blemish of self-seeking. So the Jews of old came to Bethany, to the house of Martha and Mary, that they might see not Jesus, but Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. Therefore must the eye of the intention be cleansed, that it may be single and right, and above all things which come in its way, may be directed unto Me.”
403	3	III.180	180	Quod amanti sapit Deus super omnia et in omnibus.	XXXIV That to him who loveth God is sweet above all things and in all things
404	3	III.181	181	Ecce Deus meus et omnia. Quid volo amplius? Et quid felicius desiderare possum? O, sapidum et dulce verbum,sed amantiverbumnon mundum, nec ea quæ in mundo sunt.Deus meus et omnia. Intelligenti satis dictum est, et sæpe repetere jucundum est amanti. Te siquidem præsente jucunda sunt omnia: te autem absente fastidiunt cuncta. Tu facis cor tranquillum, et pacem magnam, lætitiamque festivam. Tu faci bene sentire de omnibus, et in omnibus te laudare: nec potest aliquid diu sine te placere; sed si debet gratum esse et bene sapere, oportet gratiam tuam adesse, et condimento tuæ sapientiæ condiri.	Behold, God is mine, and all things are mine! What will I more, and what more happy thing can I desire? O delightsome and sweet world! that is, to him that loveth the Word, not the world, neither the things that are in the world. My God, my all! To him that understandeth, that word sufficeth, and to repeat it often is pleasing to him that loveth it. When Thou art present all things are pleasant; when Thou art absent, all things are wearisome. Thou makest the heart to be at rest, givest it deep peace and festal joy. Thou makest it to think rightly in every matter, and in every matter to give Thee praise; neither can anything please long without Thee but if it would be pleasant and of sweet savour, Thy grace must be there, and it is Thy wisdom which must give unto it a sweet savour.
405	3	III.182	182	Cui tu sapis, quid ei recte non sapiet? Et cui tu non sapis, quid ei recte ad jucunditatem esse poterit? Sed deficiunt in tua sapientia mundi sapientes, et qui carnem sapiunt: quia ibi plurima vanitas, et hic mors invenitur. Qui autem te per contemtum mundanorum et carnis mortificationem sequuntur, vere sapientes esse cognoscuntur, quia de vanitate ad veritatem, et de carne ad spiritum transferuntur. Istis sapit Deus, et quidquid invenitur in creaturis totum referunt ad laudem sui Conditoris. Dissimilis tamen est et multum dissimlis sapor Creatoris et creaturæ, æternitatis, et temporis, lucis increatæ et lucis illuminatæ.	To him who tasteth Thee, what can be distasteful? And to him who tasteth Thee not, what is there which can make him joyous? But the worldly wise, and they who enjoy the flesh, these fail in Thy wisdom; for in the wisdom of the world is found utter vanity, and to be carnally minded is death. But they who follow after Thee through contempt of worldly things, and mortification of the flesh, are found to be truly wise because they are carried from vanity to verity, from the flesh to the spirit. They taste that the Lord is good, and whatsoever good they find in creatures, they count it all unto the praise of the Creator. Unlike, yea, very unlike is the enjoyment of the Creator to enjoyment of the Creature, the enjoyment of eternity and of time, of light uncreated and of light reflected.
406	3	III.183	183	O, lux perpetua, cuncta creata transcendens lumina: fulgura coruscationem de sublimi penetrantem omnia intima cordis mei. Purifica, lætifica, clarifica, et vivifica spiritum meum cum suis potentiis ad inhærendum tibi jubilosis successibus. O, quando veniet hæc beata et desiderabilis hora, ut tua me saties præsentia, et sis mihi omnia in omnibus. Quamdiu hoc non datum fuerit, nec gaudium plenum erit. Adhuc, proh dolor, vivit in me vetus homo, non est totus crucifixus, non est perfecte mortuus, adhuc concupiscit fortiter adversus spiritum. Bella movent intestina, nec regnum animæ patitur esse quietum.	O Light everlasting, surpassing all created lights, dart down Thy ray from on high which shall pierce the inmost depths of my heart. Give purity, joy, clearness, life to my spirit that with all its powers it may cleave unto Thee with rapture passing man’s understanding. Oh when shall that blessed and longed-for time come when Thou shalt satisfy me with Thy presence, and be unto me All in all? So long as this is delayed, my joy shall not be full. Still, ah me! the old man liveth in me: he is not yet all crucified, not yet quite dead; still he lusteth fiercely against the spirit, wageth inward wars, nor suffereth the soul’s kingdom to be in peace.
407	3	III.184	184	Sed tu qui dominaris potestati maris, et motum fluctuum ejus tu mitigas, exsurge, adjuva me. Dissipa gentes quæ bella volunt; contere eas in virtute tua. Ostende quæso magnalia tua, et glorificetur dextera tua: quia non est spes alia, nec refugium mihi nisi in te, Domine Deus meus.	But Thou who rulest the raging of the sea, and stillest the waves thereof when they arise, rise up and help me. Scatter the people that delight in war. Destroy them by Thy power. Show forth, I beseech Thee, Thy might, and let Thy right hand be glorified, for I have no hope, no refuge, save in Thee, O Lord my God.
408	3	III.185	185	Quod non est securitas a tentatione in hac vita.	XXXV That there is no security against temptation in this life
409	3	III.186	186	Fili, nunquam es securus in hac vita: sed quoad vixeris, semper arma spiritualia tibi sunt necessaria. Inter hostes versaris; a dextris et a sinistris impugnaris. Si ergo non uteris undique scuto patientiæ, non eris diu sine vulnere. Insuper si non ponis cor tuum fixe in me cum vera voluntate cuncta patiendi propter me, non poteris ardorem istum sustinere, nec ad palmam pertingere Beatorum. Oportet ergo te viriliter omnia pertransire, et potenti manu uti adversus objecta. Nam vincenti datur manna et torpenti relinquitur multa miseria.	“My Son, thou art never secure in this life, but thy spiritual armour will always be needful for thee as long as thou livest. Thou dwellest among foes, and art attacked on the right hand and on the left. If therefore thou use not on all sides the shield of patience, thou wilt not remain long unwounded. Above all, if thou keep not thy heart fixed upon Me with steadfast purpose to bear all things for My sake, thou shalt not be able to bear the fierceness of the attack, nor to attain to the victory of the blessed. Therefore must thou struggle bravely all thy life through, and put forth a strong hand against those things which oppose thee. For to him that overcometh is the hidden manna given, but great misery is reserved for the slothful.
410	3	III.187	187	Si quæris in hac vita requiem: quomodo tunc pervenies ad æternam requiem? Non ponas te ad multam requiem, sed a magnam patientiam. Quære veram pacem non in terris sed in cælis, non in hominibus nec in cæteris creaturis, sed in Deo solo. Pro amore Dei debes omnia libenter subire, labores scilicet et dolores, tentationes et vexationes, anxietates, et necessitates, infirmitates, injurias, oblocutiones, reprehensiones, humiliationes, confusiones, correctiones et despectiones. Ego reddam ei æternam mercedem pro brevi labore, et infinitam gloriam pro transitoria confusione.	“If thou seek rest in this life, how then wilt thou attain unto the rest which is eternal? Set not thyself to attain much rest, but much patience. Seek the true peace, not in earth but in heaven, not in man nor in any created thing, but in God alone. For the love of God thou must willingly undergo all things, whether labours or sorrows, temptations, vexations, anxieties, necessities, infirmities, injuries, gainsayings, rebukes, humiliations, confusions, corrections, despisings; these things help unto virtue, these things prove the scholar of Christ; these things fashion the heavenly crown. I will give thee an eternal reward for short labour, and infinite glory for transient shame.
411	3	III.188	188	Putas, quod semper habebis pro tua voluntate consolationes spirituales. Sancti mei non habuerunt tales, sed multas gravitates et tentationes varia, magnasque desolationes, sed patienter sustinuerunt se in omnibus et magis confisi sunt Deo quam sibi: scientesquia non sunt condignæ passiones hujus temporis ad futuram gloriampromerendam. Vis tu statim habere, quod multi post multas lacrymas et magnos labores vix obtinuerunt? Exspecta Dominum, viriliter age et confortare; noli diffidere, noli discedere, sed corpus et animam expone constanter pro gloria Dei. Ego reddam plenissime; ego tecum ero in omni tribulatione.	“Thinkest thou that thou shalt always have spiritual consolations at thy will? My Saints had never such, but instead thereof manifold griefs, and divers temptations, and heavy desolations. But patiently they bore themselves in all, and trusted in God more than in themselves, knowing that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Wouldst thou have that immediately which many have hardly attained unto after many tears and hard labours? Wait for the Lord, quit thyself like a man and be strong; be not faint-hearted, nor go aside from Me, but constantly devote thy body and soul to the glory of God. I will reward thee plenteously, I will be with thee in trouble.”
412	3	III.189	189	Contra hominum vana judicia.	XXXVI Against vain judgments of men
413	3	III.190	190	Fili, jacta cor tuum firmiter in Domino; et humanum ne metuas judicium, ubi te conscientia pium reddit insontem. Bonum est et beatum taliter pati: nec hoc erit grave humili cordi et Deo magis quam sibi ipsi confidenti. Multi multa loquuntur et ideo parva fides est adhibenda. Sed et omnibus satis esse non est possibile. Et si Paulus studuit omnibus in Domino placere, et omibus omnia factus est, tamen etiam pro minimo duxit, quod ab humano die judicatus fuerit.	“My Son, anchor thy soul firmly upon God, and fear not man’s judgment, when conscience pronounceth thee pious and innocent. It is good and blessed thus to suffer; nor will it be grievous to the heart which is humble, and which trusteth in God more than in itself. Many men have many opinions, and therefore little trust is to be placed in them. But moreover it is impossible to please all. Although Paul studied to please all men in the Lord, and to become all things to all men, yet nevertheless with him it was a very small thing that he should be judged by man’s judgment.”
414	3	III.191	191	Egit satis pro aliorum ædificatione et salute, quantum in se erat, et poterat: sed ne ab aliis aliquando judicaretur, vel non despiceretur, cohibere non potuit. Ideo totum commisit Deo, qui totum noverat; et patientia et humilitate contra ora loquentium iniqua, ac etiam vana et mundana cogitatantiam, atque pro libitu suo quæque jactantium se defendit. Respondit tamen interdum, ne infirmis pro sua taciturnitate generaretur scandalum.	He laboured abundantly, as much as in him lay, for the building up and the salvation of others; but he could not avoid being sometimes judged and despised by others. Therefore he committed all to God, who knew all, and by patience and humility defended himself against evil speakers, or foolish and false thinkers, and those who accused him according to their pleasure. Nevertheless, from time to time he replied, lest his silence should become a stumbling-block to those who were weak.
415	3	III.192	192	Quis es tu, ut timeas a mortali homine?Hodie est, et cras non comparet. Deum time, et hominum pavores non expavesces. Quis potest in te aliquid? Verbis, aut injuriis sibi potius nocet, quam tibi; nec poterit judicium Dei fugere quicumque est ille. Tu habe Deum præ oculis, et noli contendere verbis querolosis. Quod si ad præsens videris succumbi, et confusionem pati quam non meruisti, non indigneris ex hoc neque per impatientiam minuas coronam tuam. Sed ad me potius respice in cælum, qui potens sum eripere ab omni confusione et injuria et unicuique reddere secundum opera sua.	“Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die? To-day he is, and to-morrow his place is not found. Fear God and thou shalt not quail before the terrors of men. What can any man do against thee by words or deeds? He hurteth himself more than thee, nor shall he escape the judgment of God, whosoever he may be. Have thou God before thine eyes, and do not contend with fretful words. And if for the present thou seem to give way, and to suffer confusion which thou hast not deserved, be not angry at this, nor by impatience diminish thy reward; but rather look up to Me in heaven, for I am able to deliver thee from all confusion and hurt, and to render to every man according to his works.”
416	3	III.193	193	De pura et integra resignatione cordis ad obtinendam sui libertatem.	XXXVII Of pure and entire resignation of self, for the obtaining liberty of heart
417	3	III.194	194	Fili, relinque te, et invenies me; sta sine electione, et omni proprietate et semper lucraberis. Nam et adjicietur tibi amplior gratia statim, ut te resignaveris nec resumpseris.	“My Son, lose thyself and thou shalt find Me. Stand still without all choosing and all thought of self, and thou shalt ever be a gainer. For more grace shall be added to thee, as soon as thou resignest thyself, and so long as thou dost not turn back to take thyself again.”
418	3	III.195	195	Domine, quoties me resignabo? et in quibus me relinquam?	O Lord, how often shall I resign myself, and in what things shall I lose myself?
419	3	III.196	196	Semper et in omni hora: sicut in parvo, sic et in magno. Nihil excipio, sed in omnibus te nudatum inveniri volo. Alioquin quomodo poteris esse meus et ego tuus, nisi fueris ab omni propria voluntate intus et foris spoliatus? Quanto celerius hoc agi, tanto melius habebis; et quanto plenius et sincerius, tanto mihi plus placebis, et amplius lucraberis.	“Always; every hour: in that which is little, and in that which is great. I make no exception, but will that thou be found naked in all things. Otherwise how canst thou be Mine and I thine, unless thou be inwardly and outwardly free from every will of thine own? The sooner thou dost this, the better shall it be with thee; and the more fully and sincerely, the more thou shalt please Me, and the more abundantly shalt thou be rewarded.
420	3	III.197	197	Quidam se resignant, sed cum aliqua exceptione: non enim plene in Deo confidunt; ideo providere sibi satagunt. Quidam etiam primo offerunt totum, sed postea tentatione pulsante ad propria redeunt; ideo minime in virtute proficiunt. Hi ad veram puri cordis libertatem, et jucundæ familiaritatis meæ gratiam non pertingent, nisi integra resignatione, et quotidiana sui immolatione prius facta, sine qua non stabit, nec stat unio fruitiva.	“Some resign themselves, but with certain reservations, for they do not fully trust in God, therefore they think that they have some provision to make for themselves. Some again at first offer everything; but afterwards being pressed by temptation they return to their own devices, and thus make no progress in virtue. They will not attain to the true liberty of a pure heart, nor to the grace of My sweet companionship, unless they first entirely resign themselves and daily offer themselves up as a sacrifice; without this the union which bringeth forth fruit standeth not nor will stand.
421	3	III.198	198	Dixi tibi sæpissime et iterum nunc dico: Relinque te, resigna te, et frueris magna interna pace. Da totum pro toto, niihil exquire, nil repete, sta pure et inhæsitanter in me, et habebis me. Eris liber in corde, et tenebræ non conculcabunt te. Ad hoc conare, hoc ora, hoc stude desiderare, ut ab omni proprietate possis exspoliari et nudus nudum Jesum sequi, tibi mori, et mihi æternaliter vivere. Tunc deficient omnes vanæ phantasiæ, conturbationes iniquæ, et curæ superfluæ. Tunc etiam recedet immoderatus timor, et inordinatus amor morietur.	“Many a time I have said unto thee, and now say again, Give thyself up, resign thyself, and thou shalt have great inward peace. Give all for all; demand nothing, ask nothing in return; stand simply and with no hesitation in Me, and thou shalt possess Me. Thou shalt have liberty of heart, and the darkness shall not overwhelm thee. For this strive thou, pray for it, long after it, that thou mayest be delivered from all possession of thyself, and nakedly follow Jesus who was made naked for thee; mayest die unto thyself and live eternally to Me. Then shall all vain fancies disappear, all evil disturbings, and superfluous cares. Then also shall immoderate fear depart from thee, and inordinate love shall die.”
422	3	III.199	199	De bono regimine in externis, et recursu ad Deum in periculis.	XXXVIII Of a good government in external things, and of having recourse to God in dangers
423	3	III.200	200	Fili, ad istud diligenter tendere debes, ut in omni loco, actione seu occupatione externa sis intus liber, et tui ipsius potens, et sint omnia sub te, et tu non sub eis, ut sis dominus actionum tuarum, et rector, non servus, nec emptitius, sed magis exemtus verusque Hebræus, in fortem ac libertatem transiens filiorum Dei; qui stant supra præsentia et speculantur æterna; qui transitoria intuentur sinistro oculo, et dextro cælestia, quos temporalia non trahunt ad inhærendum, sed trahunt ipsi ea magis ad bene serviendum, prout ordinata sunt a Deo, et instituta a summo Opifice, qui nil inordinatum reliquit in sua creatura.	“My Son, for this thou must diligently make thy endeavour, that in every place and outward action or occupation thou mayest be free within, and have power over thyself; and that all things be under thee, not thou under them; that thou be master and ruler of thy actions, not a slave or hireling, but rather a free and true Hebrew, entering into the lot and the liberty of the children of God, who stand above the present and look upon the eternal, who with the left eye behold things transitory, and with the right things heavenly; whom temporal things draw not to cleave unto, but who rather draw temporal things to do them good service, even as they were ordained of God to do, and appointed by the Master Workman, who hath left nought in His creation without aim and end.
424	3	III.201	201	Si autem in omni eventu stas non in apparentia externa, nec oculo carnali lustras visa vel audita, sed mox in qualibet causa intras cum Moyse in tabernaculum ad consulendum Dominum: et audies nonnunquam divinum responsum et redies instructus de multis præsentibus et futuris. Semper enim Moyses recursum habuit ad tabernaculum pro dubiis et quæstionibus solvendis fugitque ad oratiois adjutorium pro periculis et improbitatibus hominum sublevandis. Sic et tu confugere debes in cordis tui secretarium divinum intentius implorando auxilium. Propterea namque Josue, et filii Israel a Gabaonitis leguntur decepti, quia os Domini non prius interrogaverunt, sed nimium creduli dulcibus sermonibus falsa pietate delusi sunt.	“And if in any chance of life thou stand not in outward appearances, nor judgest things which are seen and heard by the fleshly sense, but straightway in every cause enterest with Moses into the tabernacle to ask counsel of God; thou shalt hear a divine response and come forth instructed concerning many things that are and shall be. For always Moses had recourse to the tabernacle for the solving of all doubts and questionings; and fled to the help of prayer to be delivered from the dangers and evil deeds of men. Thus also oughtest thou to fly to the secret chamber of thy heart, and earnestly implore the divine succour. For this cause we read that Joshua and the children of Israel were deceived by the Gibeonites, that they asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord, but being too ready to listen to fair speeches, were deceived by pretended piety.”
425	3	III.202	202	Quod non sit importunus in negociis.	XXXIX That man must not be immersed in business
426	3	III.203	203	Fili, committe mihi semper causam tuam, ego bene disponam in tempore suo. Exspecta ordinationem meam et senties exinde profectum.	“My Son, always commit thy cause to Me; I will dispose it aright in due time. Wait for My arrangement of it, and then thou shalt find it for thy profit.”
427	3	III.204	204	Domine, satis libenter omnes res tibi committo, quia parum potest cogitatio mea proficere. Utinam non multum adhærerem futuris eventibus, sed ad beneplacitum tuum me incunctanter offerrem.	O Lord, right freely I commit all things to Thee; for my planning can profit but little. Oh that I did not dwell so much on future events, but could offer myself altogether to Thy pleasures without delay.
428	3	III.205	205	Fili mi, sæpe homo rem aliquam agitat, quam desiderat: sed cum ad eam pervenerit, aliter incipit sentire, quia affectiones circa idem non sunt durabiles, sed magis de uno vel in aliud nos impellunt. Non est ergo minimum etiam in minimis se relinquere.	“My Son, a man often striveth vehemently after somewhat which he desireth; but when he hath obtained it he beginneth to be of another mind, because his affections towards it are not lasting, but rather rush on from one thing to another. Therefore it is not really a small thing, when in small things we resist self.”
429	3	III.206	206	Verus profectus hominis est abnegatio sui ipsius, et homo abnegatus valde liber est et securus. Sed antiquus hosti, omnibus bonis adversans, a tentatione non cessat, et die noctuque graves molitur insidias, si forte in laqueum deceptionis possit præcipitare incautum.Vigilate et orate,dicit Dominus,ut non intretis in tentationem.	The true progress of man lieth in self-denial, and a man who denieth himself is free and safe. But the old enemy, opposer of all good things, ceaseth not from temptation; but day and night setteth his wicked snares, if haply he may be able to entrap the unwary. Watch and pray, saith the Lord, lest ye enter into temptation.
430	3	III.207	207	Quod homo nihil boni ex se habet, et de nullo gloriari debet.	XL That man hath no good in himself, and nothing whereof to glory
431	3	III.208	208	Domine, quid est homo, quod memor sis ejus, aut filius hominis, quia visitas eum?Quid promeruit homo, ut dares illi gratiam tuam? Domine, quid possum conqueri, si deseris me? aud quid juste obtendere possum, si quod peto non feceris? Certe hoc in veritate cogitare possum et dicere: Domine, nihil sum; nihil boni ex me habeo, sed in omnibus deficio, et ad nihil semper tendo. Ego nisi a te fuero adjutus et interius informatus, totus efficior tepidus et dissolutus.	Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him? What hath man deserved, that Thou shouldest bestow thy favour upon him? Lord, what cause can I have of complaint, if Thou forsake me? Or what can I justly allege, if Thou refuse to hear my petition? Of a truth, this I may truly think and say, Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing that is good of myself, but I fall short in all things, and ever tend unto nothing. And unless I am helped by Thee and inwardly supported, I become altogether lukewarm and reckless.
432	3	III.209	209	Tu autem, Domine, semper idem ipse es, et permanes in æternum: semper bonus et justus et sanctus; bene, juste et sancte agens omnia et disponens in sapientia. Sed ego, qui ad defectum magis pronus sum quam ad profectum, non semper sum in uno statu perdurans, quia septem tempora mutantur super me. Verumtamen cito melius sit, cum tibi placuerit, et manum porrexeris adjutricem: quia tu solus sine humano suffragio poteris auxiliari et in tantum confirmare, ut vultus meus amplius in diversa non mutetur, sed in te uno cor meum convertatur et quiescat.	But Thou, O Lord, art always the same, and endurest for ever, always good, righteous, and holy; doing all things well, righteously, and holily, and disposing all in Thy wisdom. But I who am more ready to go forward than backward, never continue in one stay, because changes sevenfold pass over me. Yet it quickly becometh better when it so pleaseth Thee, and Thou puttest forth Thy hand to help me; because Thou alone canst aid without help of man, and canst so strengthen me that my countenance shall be no more changed, but my heart shall be turned to Thee, and rest in Thee alone.
433	3	III.210	210	Unde si bene scirem omnem humanam consolationem abjicere, sive propter devotionem adipiscendam, sive propter necessitatem qua compellor te quærere, quia non est homo qui me consoletur: tunc merito possem de gratia sperare tua, et de dono novæ consolationis exultare.	Wherefore, if I but knew well how to reject all human consolations, whether for the sake of gaining devotion, or because of the necessity by which I was compelled to seek Thee, seeing there is no man who can comfort me; then could I worthily trust in Thy grace, and rejoice in the gift of new consolation.
434	3	III.211	211	Gratias tibi, unde totum venit quotiescumque mihi bene succedit. Ego autem vanitas, et nihilum ante te, inconstans homo et infirmus. Unde possum gloriari? aut cur appeto reputari? Numquid de nihilo? et hoc vanissimum est. Vere inanis gloria pestis mala, vanitas maxima, quia a vera trahit gloria, et cælesti spoliat gratia. Dum enim homo complacet sibi, displicet tibi; dum inhiat laudibus humanis, privatur veris virtutibus.	Thanks be to Thee, from whom all cometh, whensoever it goeth well with me! But I am vanity and nothing in Thy sight, a man inconstant and weak. What then have I whereof to glory, or why do I long to be held in honour? Is it not for nought? This also is utterly vain. Verily vain glory is an evil plague, the greatest of vanities, because it draweth us away from the true glory, and robbeth us of heavenly grace. For whilst a man pleaseth himself he displeaseth Thee; whilst he gapeth after the praises of man, he is deprived of true virtues.
435	3	III.212	212	Est autem vera gloria et exultatio sancta gloriari in te et non in se, gaudere in nomine tuo, non in virtute propria, nec in aliqua creatura delectari nisi propter te. Laudetur nomen tuum, non meum; magnificetur opus tuum, non meum; benedicatur nomen sanctum tuum, non meum; nihil autem attribuatur mihi de laudibus hominum. Tu gloria mea, tu exaltatio cordis mei. In te gloriabor et exultabo tota die;pro me autem nihil, nisi in infirmatibus meis.	But true glory and holy rejoicing lieth in glorying in Thee and not in self; in rejoicing in Thy Name, not in our own virtue; in not taking delight in any creature, save only for Thy sake. Let thy Name, not mine be praised; let Thy work, not mine be magnified; let Thy holy Name be blessed, but to me let nought be given of the praises of men. Thou art my glory, Thou art the joy of my heart. In Thee will I make my boast and be glad all the day long, but for myself let me not glory save only in my infirmities.
436	3	III.213	213	Quærant Judæi gloriam quæ ab invicem est: ego hanc requiram quæ a solo Deo est. Omnis quidem gloria humana, omnis honor temporalis, omnis altitudo mundana æternæ gloriæ tuæ comparata vanitas est et stultitia. O, veritas mea, et misericordia mea Deus meus, Trinitas beata: tibi soli laus, vertus, honor et gloria per infinita sæculorum sæcula.	Let the Jews seek the honour which cometh from one another; but I will ask for that which cometh from God only. Truly all human glory, all temporal honour, all worldly exultation, compared to Thy eternal glory, is but vanity and folly. O God my Truth and my Mercy, Blessed Trinity, to Thee alone be all praise, honour, power, and glory for ever and for ever.
437	3	III.214	214	De contemtu omnis honoris temporalis.	XLI Of contempt of all temporal honour
438	3	III.215	215	Fili, noli tibi attrahere, si videas alios honorari et elevari, te autem despici et humiliari. Erige cor tuum ad me in cælum et non contristabit te contemtus hominis in terris.	“My Son, make it no matter of thine, if thou see others honoured and exalted, and thyself despised and humbled. Lift up thine heart to Me in heaven, and then the contempt of men upon earth will not make thee sad.”
439	3	III.216	216	Domine, in cæcitate sumus et vanitate cito seducimur. Si recte me inspicio, nunquam facta mihi est injuria ab aliqua creatura: unde nec juste habeo conqueri adversum te: quia autem frequenter et graviter peccavi tibi, merito armatur contra me omnis creatura. Mihi igitur juste debetur confusio, et contemtus: tibi autem laus, honor, virtus et gloria. Et nisi ad hoc me præparavero, quod velim libenter ab omni creatura despici et relinqui, atque penitus nihil videri, non possum interius pacificari et stabiliri nec spiritualiter illuminari, neque tibi plene uniri.	O Lord, we are in blindness, and are quickly seduced by vanity. If I look rightly within myself, never was injury done unto me by any creature, and therefore I have nought whereof to complain before Thee. But because I have many times and grievously sinned against Thee, all creatures do justly take arms against me. Therefore to me confusion and contempt are justly due, but to Thee praise and honour and glory. And except I dispose myself for this, namely, to be willing that every creature should despise and desert me, and that I should be esteemed altogether as nothing, I cannot be inwardly filled with peace and strength, nor spiritually enlightened, nor fully united to Thee.
440	3	III.217	217	Quod pax non est ponenda in hominibus.	XLII That our peace is not to be placed in men
441	3	III.218	218	Fili, si ponis pacem tuam cum aliqua persona propter tuum sentire vel convivere, instabilis eris et implacatus. Sed si recursum habes ad semper viventem et manentem veritatem, non contristabit te amicus recedens aut moriens. In me debet amici dilectio stare, et propter me diligendus est quisquis tibi bonus visus est, et multum carus in hac vita. Sine me non valet, nec durabit amicitia; nec est verba et munda dilectio, quam ego non copulo. Ita mortuus esse debes talibus affectionibus dilectorum hominum, ut quantum ad te pertinet sine humano optes esse consortio. Tanto homo magis Deo appropinquat, quanto ab omni solatio terreno longius recedit. Tanto etiam altius ascendit ad Deum, quanto profundius in se descendit, et plus sibi ipsi vilescit.	“My Son, if thou set thy peace on any person because thou hast high opinion of him, and art familiar with him, thou shalt be unstable and entangled. But if thou betake thyself to the ever-living and abiding Truth, the desertion or death of a friend shall not make thee sad. In Me ought the love of thy friend to subsist, and for My sake is every one to be loved, whosoever he be, who appeareth to thee good, and is very dear to thee in this life. Without Me friendship hath no strength or endurance, neither is that love true and pure, which I unite not. Thou oughtest to be so dead to such affections of beloved friends, that as far as in thee lieth, thou wouldst rather choose to be without any companionship of men. The nearer a man approacheth to God, the further he recedeth from all earthly solace. The deeper also he descendeth into himself, and the viler he appeareth in his own eyes, the higher he ascendeth towards God.
442	3	III.219	219	Qui autem aliquid boni sibi attribuit, gratiam Dei in se invenire impedit: quia gratia Spiritus sancti cor humile quærit semper. Si scires te perfecte annihilare, atque ab omni creato amore evacurare, tunc deberem in te cum magna gratia emanare. Quando tu respicis ad creaturas, subtrahitur tibi aspectus Creatoris. Disce te in omnibus propter Creatoriem vincere: tunc ad divinam valebis cognitionem pertingere. Quantumcumque modicum sit, si quid inordinate diligitur et respicitur, retardat a summo bono, et vitiat.	“But he who attributeth anything good to himself, hindereth the grace of God from coming to him, because the grace of the Holy Ghost ever seeketh the humble heart. If thou couldst make thyself utterly nothing, and empty thyself of the love of every creature, then should it be My part to overflow unto thee with great grace. When thou settest thine eyes upon creatures, the face of the Creator is withdrawn from thee. Learn in all things to conquer thyself for thy Creator’s sake, then shalt thou be able to attain unto divine knowledge. How small soever anything be, if it be loved and regarded inordinately, it holdeth us back from the highest good, and corrupteth.”
443	3	III.220	220	Contra vanam, et sæcularem scientiam.	XLIII Against vain and worldly knowledge
444	3	III.221	221	Fili, non moveant te pulchra et subtilia dicta hominum:non est enim regnum Dei in sermone, sed in virtute.Attende verba mea quæ cordo accendunt et mentes illuminant, inducunt compunctionem, et variam ingerunt consolationem. Nunquam ad hoc legas verbum, ut doctior aut sapientior possis videri; sed stude mortificationem vitiorum, quia hoc amplius tibi proderit, quam notitia multarum difficilium quæstionum.	“My Son, let not the fair and subtle sayings of men move thee. For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. Give ear to My words, for they kindle the heart and enlighten the mind, they bring contrition, and they supply manifold consolations. Never read thou the word that thou mayest appear more learned or wise; but study for the mortification of thy sins, for this will be far more profitable for thee than the knowledge of many difficult questions.
445	3	III.222	222	Cum multa legeris et cognoveris, ad unum oportet te venire principium. Ego sum qui doceo hominem scientiam et clariorem intelligentiam parvulis tribuo quam ab homine possit doceri. Cui ego loquar, cito sapiens erit et multum in spiritu proficiet. Væ illis qui multa curiosa ab hominibus quærunt, et de via mihi serviendi parum curant. Veniet tempus quando apparebit Magister magistrorum Christus, Dominus Angelorum, cunctorum auditurus lectiones, et singulorum examinaturus conscientias, et tuncscrutabitur Hierusalem in lucerniset manifesta erunt abscondita tenebrarum, tacebuntque argumenta linguarum.	“When thou hast read and learned many things, thou must always return to one first principle. I am He that teacheth man knowledge, and I give unto babes clearer knowledge than can be taught by man. He to whom I speak will be quickly wise and shall grow much in the spirit. Woe unto them who inquire into many curious questions from men, and take little heed concerning the way of My service. The time will come when Christ will appear, the Master of masters, the Lord of the Angels, to hear the lessons of all, that is to examine the consciences of each one. And then will He search Jerusalem with candles, and the hidden things of darkness shall be made manifest, and the arguings of tongues shall be silent.
446	3	III.223	223	Ego sum qui humilem in puncto elevo mentem, ut plures æternæ veritatis capiat rationes quam si quis decem annis studuisset in scholis. Ego doceo sine strepitu verborum, sine confusione opinionum, sine fastu honoris, sine pugnatione argumentorum. Ego sum qui doceo terrena despicere, præsentia fastidire, æterna quærere, æterna sapere, honores fugere, scandala sufferre, omnem spem in me ponere, extra me nihil cupere, et super omnia ardenter me amare.	“I am He who in an instant lift up the humble spirit, to learn more reasonings of the Eternal Truth, than if a man had studied ten years in the schools. I teach without noise of words, without confusion of opinions, without striving after honour, without clash of arguments. I am He who teach men to despise earthly things, to loathe things present, to seek things heavenly, to enjoy things eternal, to flee honours, to endure offences, to place all hope in Me, to desire nothing apart from Me, and above all things to love Me ardently.
447	3	III.224	224	Nam quidam amando me intime, didicit divina, et loquebatur mirabilia. Plus profecit in relinquendo omnia, quam in studendo subtilia. Sed loquor communia aliis, aliis specialia, aliquibus in signis et figuris dulciter appareo; quibusdam vero in lumine, multa revelo mysteria. Una vox librorum, sed non æque omnes informat, quia intus sum doctor veritatis, cordis scrutator, cognitationum intellector, actionum promotor, distribuens singulis sicut dignum judicavero.	“For there was one, who by loving Me from the bottom of his heart, learned divine things, and spake things that were wonderful; he profited more by forsaking all things than by studying subtleties. But to some I speak common things, to others special; to some I appear gently in signs and figures, and again to some I reveal mysteries in much light. The voice of books is one, but it informeth not all alike; because I inwardly am the Teacher of truth, the Searcher of the heart, the Discerner of the thoughts, the Mover of actions, distributing to each man, as I judge meet.”
448	3	III.225	225	De non attrahendo res exteriores.	XLIV Of not troubling ourselves about outward things
449	3	III.226	226	Fili, oportet te in multis esse inscium et æstimare te tamquam mortuum super terram et cui mundus totus crucifixus sit. Multa etiam oportet surda aure pertransire et quæ tuæ pacis sunt magis cogitare. Utilius est oculos a rebus displicentibus avertere, et unicuique suum sentire relinquere, quam contentiosis sermonibus deservire. Si bene steteris cum Deo, et ejus judicium aspexeris facilius te victum portabis.	“My Son, in many things it behoveth thee to be ignorant, and to esteem thyself as one dead upon the earth, and as one to whom the whole world is crucified. Many things also thou must pass by with deaf ear, and must rather think upon those things which belong unto thy peace. It is more profitable to turn away thine eyes from those things that displease, and to leave each man to his own opinion, than to give thyself to discourses of strife. If thou stand well with God and hast His judgment in thy mind, thou wilt verily easily bear to be as one conquered.”
450	3	III.227	227	O, Domine, quousque venimus? Ecce damnum defletur temporale: pro modico quæstu laboratur et curritur et spirituale detrimentum in oblivionem transit, et vix sero reditur. Quod parum vel nihil prodest, attenditur et quod summe necessarium est, negligenter præteritur, quia totus homo ad externa defluit, et nisi cito resipiscat, libens in exterioribus jacet.	O Lord, to what have we come? Behold a temporal loss is mourned over; for a trifling gain we labour and hurry; and spiritual loss passeth away into forgetfulness, and we rarely recover it. That which profiteth little or nothing is looked after, and that which is altogether necessary is negligently passed by; because the whole man slideth away to outward things, and unless he quickly recovereth himself in outward things he willingly lieth down.
451	3	III.228	228	Quod omnibus non est credendum, et de facili lapsu verborum.	XLV That we must not believe everyone, and that we are prone to fall in our words
452	3	III.229	229	Da mihi auxilium, Domine, de tribulatione, quia vana salus hominis.Quam sæpe ibi non inveni fidem, ubi me habere putavi: quoties etiam libi reperi, ubi minus præsumsi. Vana ergo spes in hominibus, salus autem justorum in te, Deus. Benedictus sis, Domine Deus, in omnibus quæ nobis accidunt. Infirmi sumus et instabiles; cito fallimur et permutamur.	Lord, be thou my help in trouble, for vain is the help of man. How often have I failed to find faithfulness, where I thought I possessed it. How many times I have found it where I least expected. Vain therefore is hope in men, but the salvation of the just, O God, is in Thee. Blessed be thou, O Lord my God, in all things which happen unto us. We are weak and unstable, we are quickly deceived and quite changed.
453	3	III.230	230	Quis est homo qui ita caute et circumspecte in omnibus se custodire valeat: ut aliquando in aliquam deceptionem, vel perplexitatem non veniat. Sed qui in te, Domine, confidit, ac simplici ex corde quærit, non tam facile labitur. Et si inciderit in aliquam tribulationem, quomodocumque etiam fuerit implicatus, citius per te eruetur, aut a te consolabitur, quia tu non deseris in te sperantem usque in finem. Rarus fidus amicus, in cunctis amici perseverans pressuris. Tu Domine, tu solus es fidelissimus in omnibus, et præter te non est alter talis.	Who is the man who is able to keep himself so warily and circumspectly as not sometimes to come into some snare of perplexity? But he who trusteth in Thee, O Lord, and seeketh Thee with an unfeigned heart, doth not so easily slip. And if he fall into any tribulation, howsoever he may be entangled, yet very quickly he shall be delivered through Thee, or by Thee shall be comforted, because Thou wilt not forsake him that trusteth in Thee unto the end. A friend who continueth faithful in all the distresses of his friend is rare to be found. Thou, O Lord, Thou alone art most faithful in all things, and there is none other like unto Thee.
454	3	III.231	231	O, quam bene sapuit illa anima sancta, quæ dixit: Mens mea solidata est, et in Christo fundata. Si ita mecum foret, non tam facile timor humanus me sollicitaret, nec verborum jacula moverent. Quis omnia prævidere, quis præcavere futura mala sufficit? Si prævisa etiam lædunt sæpe, quid improvisa nisi graviter feriunt? Sed quare mihi mesero non melius providi? Cur etiam tam facile aliis credidi? Sed homines sumus, nec aliud quam fragiles homines sumus, etsi Angeli a multus æstimamur, et dicimur. Cui credam, Domine? Cui credam nisi tibi? Es veritas quænon fallis, nec falli potes. Et rursum: Omnis homo mendax, instabilis, et labilis maxime in verbis, ita ut statim vix credit debeat, quod rectum in facie sonare videtur.	Oh, how truly wise was that holy soul which said, “My mind is steadfastly fixed, and it is grounded in Christ.” If thus it were with me, the fear of man should not so easily tempt me, nor the arrows of words move me. Who is sufficient to foresee all things, who to guard beforehand against future ills? If even things which are foreseen sometimes hurt us, what can things which are not foreseen do, but grievously injure? But wherefore have I not better provided for myself, miserable that I am? Why, too, have I given such heed to others? But we are men, nor are we other than frail men, even though by many we are reckoned and called angels. Whom shall I trust, O Lord, whom shall I trust but Thee? Thou art the Truth, and deceivest not, nor canst be deceived. And on the other hand, Every man is a liar, weak, unstable and frail, especially in his words, so that one ought scarcely ever to believe what seemeth to sound right on the face of it.
455	3	III.232	232	Quam prudenter præmonuisti,cavendum ab hominibus esse, et quia inimici hominis domestici ejus,nec credendum, si quis dixerit:Ecce hic, aut ecce illic.Doctus sum damno et utinam ad cautelam majorem, non ad insipientiam mihi. Cautus esto, quidam ait; cautus esto, serva apud te quod dico: et dum ego sileo et absconditum credo, nec ille silere potest, quod silendum petiit; sed statim prodit me, et se, et abit. Ab hujusmodi rabulis et incautis hominibus protege me, Domine, ne in manus eorum incideam, nec unquam talia committam. Verbum verum, et stabile da in os meum et linguam calidam longe fac a me. Quod pati nolo, omnimodo cavere debeo.	With what wisdom hast thou warned us beforehand to beware of men, and that a man’s foes are they of his own household, and that we must not believe if one say unto us Lo here, or Lo there. I have been taught by my loss, and O that I may prove more careful and not foolish hereby. “Be cautious,” saith some one: “be cautious, keep unto thyself what I tell thee.” And whilst I am silent and believe that it is hid with me, he himself cannot keep silence concerning it, but straightway betrayeth me and himself, and goeth his way. Protect me, O Lord, from such mischief-making and reckless men; let me not fall into their hands, nor ever do such things myself. Put a true and steadfast word into my mouth, and remove a deceitful tongue far from me. What I would not suffer, I ought by all means to beware of doing.
456	3	III.233	233	O, quam bonum et pacificum de aliis silere, nec indifferenter omnia credere, nec de facili ulterius effari, paucis seipsum revelare, te semper inspectorem cordis quærere, nec omni verborum vento circumferri, sed omnia intima et externa secundum tuæ beneplacitum voluntatis optare perfici. Quam tutum pro conservatione cælestis gratiæ, humanam fugere apparentiam nec appetere quæ foris admirationem videntur præbere: sed ea tota sedulitate sectari, quæ vitæ emendtionem dant, et servorem. Quam multis nocuit virtus scita, ac proprie laudata. Quam sane profuit gratia servata silentio in hac fragili vita, quæ tota tentatio fertur et militia.	Oh, how good and peacemaking a thing it is to be silent concerning others, and not carelessly to believe all reports, nor to hand them on further; how good also to lay one’s self open to few, to seek ever to have Thee as the beholder of the heart; not to be carried about with every wind of words, but to desire that all things inward and outward be done according to the good pleasure of Thy will! How safe for the preserving of heavenly grace to fly from human approval, and not to long after the things which seem to win admiration abroad, but to follow with all earnestness those things which bring amendment of life and heavenly fervour! How many have been injured by their virtue being made known and too hastily praised. How truly profitable hath been grace preserved in silence in this frail life, which, as we are told, is all temptation and warfare.
457	3	III.234	234	De confidentia in Deo habenda, quando insurgunt verborum jacula.	XLVI Of having confidence in God when evil words are cast at us
458	3	III.235	235	Fili, sta firmiter et spera in me. Quid enim sunt verba, nisi verba? per aerem volant, sed lapidem non lædunt. Si reus es, cogita, quod libenter velis emendare. Si nihil tibi conscius es, pensa: pensa quod velis libenter pro Deo hoc sustinere. Parum satis est ut vel verba interdum sustineas, qui necdum fortia verbera tolerare vales. Et quare tam parva tibi ad cor transeunt: nisi quia adhuc carnalis es, et homines magis, quam oportet, attendis? Nam quia despici metuis, reprehendi pro excessibus non vis, et excusationum quæris umbracula.	“My Son, stand fast and believe in Me. For what are words but words? They fly through the air, but they bruise no stone. If thou are guilty, think how thou wouldst gladly amend thyself; if thou knowest nothing against thyself, consider that thou wilt gladly bear this for God’s sake. It is little enough that thou sometimes hast to bear hard words, for thou art not yet able to bear hard blows. And wherefore do such trivial matters go to thine heart, except that thou art yet carnal, and regardest men more than thou oughtest? For because thou fearest to be despised, thou art unwilling to be reproved for thy faults, and seekest paltry shelters of excuses.
459	3	III.236	236	Sed inspice te melius, et cognosces quia vivit adhuc in te mundus, et vanus amor placendi hominibus. Cum enim bassari refugis, et confundi etiam pro defectibus, constat utique, quod nec verus humilis sis, nec vere mundo mortuus, nec tibi mundus crucifixus. Sed audi verba mea, et non curabis decem millia hominum verba. Ecce, si cuncta contra te dicerentur quæ fingi malitionsissime possunt, quid tibi noceret, si omnino transire permitteres, nec plus, quam festucam perpenderes? Numquid vel unum capillum tibi etrahere possent?	“But look better into thyself, and thou shalt know that the world is still alive in thee, and the vain love of pleasing men. For when thou fleest away from being abased and confounded for thy faults, it is plain that thou art neither truly humble nor truly dead to the world, and that the world is not crucified to thee. But hearken to My word, and thou shalt not care for ten thousand words of men. Behold, if all things could be said against thee which the utmost malice could invent, what should it hurt thee if thou wert altogether to let it go, and make no more account of it than of a mote? Could it pluck out a single hair of thy head?
460	3	III.237	237	Sed qui cor intus non habent, nec Deum præ ocuis, facile faciliterque verbo moventur vituperationis. Qui autem in me confidit, nec proprio judicio stare appetit, absque humano terrore erit. Ego sum enim judex, et cognitor omnium secretorum; Ego scio, qualiter res acta est; Ego injuriantem novi, et sustinentem. A me exiit verbum istud; me permittente hoc accidit,ut revelentur ex multis cordibus cogitationes.Ego reum et innocentem judicabo; sed utrumque occulto judicio volui probare ante.	“But he that hath no heart within him, and hath not God before his eyes, is easily moved by a word of reproach; but he who trusteth in Me, and seeketh not to abide by his own judgment, shall be free from the fear of men. For I am the Judge and the Discerner of all secrets; I know how the thing hath been done; I know both the injurer and the bearer. From Me went forth that word, by My permission this hath happened, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. I shall judge the guilty and the innocent; but beforehand I have willed to try them both by a secret judgment.
461	3	III.238	238	Testimonium hominum sæpe salit; meum judicium verum est, stabit et non subvertetur. Latet plerumque, et paucis ad singula patet; numquam tamen errat, nec errare potest, etiamsi oculis insipientium non rectum videatur. Ad me ergo recurrendum est in omni judicio, nec proprio innitendum arbitrio;justusenimnon conturbabitur, quidquid a Deo ei acciderit.Et si injuste aliquid contra eum prolatum fuerit, non multum curabit; sed nec vane exultabit, si per alios rationabiliter excusetur. Pensat namque quia ego sumscrutans corda et renes;qui non judico secundum faciem et humanam apparentiam. Nam sæpe etiam oculis meis reperitur culpabile, quod hominum judicio creditur laudabile.	“The testimony of men often deceiveth. My judgment is true; it will stand, and it shall not be overturned. It commonly lieth hid, and only to few in certain cases is it made known; yet it never erreth, nor can err, although it seem not right to the eyes of foolish men. To Me, therefore, must men have recourse in all judgment, and must not lean to their opinion. For there shall no evil happen to the just, whatsoever may be sent to him by God. Even though some unjust charge be brought against him, he will care little; nor, again, will he exult above measure, if through others he be clearly vindicated. For he considereth that I am He who try the hearts and reins, who judge not outwardly and according to human appearance; for often in Mine eyes that is found blameworthy which in the judgment of men is held worthy of praise.”
462	3	III.239	239	Domine Deus, judex juste, fortis et patiens, qui hominum nosti fragilitatem et pravitatem, esto robur meum, et tota fiducia mea; non enim mihi sufficit conscientia mea. Tu nosti, quod ego non novi, et ideo in omni reprehensione me humiliare debui, et mansuete sustinere. Ignosce ergo mihi propitius, quoties sic non egi; et dona iterum gratiam amplioris sufferentiæ. Melior est enim mihi tua copiosa misericordia ad consecutionem indulgentiæ, quam mea opinata justitia pro defensione latentis conscientiæ.Et si mihi nihil conscius sum, tamen in hoc justificare me non possum: quiaremota misericordia tuanon justificabitur in conspectu tuo omnis vivens.	O Lord God, O Judge, just, strong, and patient, who knowest the frailty and sinfulness of men, be Thou my strength and my whole confidence; for my own conscience sufficeth me not. Thou knowest what I know not; and therefore ought I under all rebuke to humble myself, and to bear it meekly. Therefore mercifully forgive me as often as I have not done this, and grant me the next time the grace of greater endurance. For better unto me is Thine abundant pity for the attainment of Thy pardon, than the righteousness which I believe myself to have for defence against my conscience, which lieth wait against me. Although I know nothing against myself, yet I am not hereby justified, because if Thy mercy were removed away, in Thy sight should no man living be justified.
463	3	III.240	240	Quod omnia gravia pro æterna vita sunt toleranda.	XLVII That all troubles are to be endured for the sake of eternal life
464	3	III.241	241	Fili, non frangant te labores quos assumsisti propter me, nec tribulationes te dejiciant usquequaque; sed mea promissio in omni eventu te roboret, et consoletur. Ego sufficiens sum ad reddendum supra omnem modum et mensuram. Non hic diu laborabis, nec semper gravaberis doloribus. Exspecta paulisper, et videbis celerem finem malorum. Veniet una hora, quando cessabit omnis labor et tumultus. Modicum est, et breve omne, quod transit cum tempore.	“My Son, let not the labours which thou hast undertaken for Me break thee down, nor let tribulations cast thee down in any wise, but let my promise strengthen and comfort thee in every event. I am sufficient to reward thee above all measure and extent. Not long shalt thou labour here, nor always be weighed down with sorrows. Wait yet a little while, and thou shalt see a speedy end of thine evils. An hour shall come when all labour and confusion shall cease. Little and short is all that passeth away with time.
465	3	III.242	242	Age quod agis; fideliter labora in vinea mea, ego ero merces tua. Scribe, lege, canta, geme, tace, ora, sustine viriliter contraria: digna est his omnibus et majoribus præliis vita æterna. Veniet pax in die una, quæ nota est Domino. Non enim erit dies vel nox hujus scilicet temporis, sed lux perpetua, claritas infinita, pax firma et requies secura. Non dices tunc:Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis hujus?Nec clamabis:Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est,quoniam præcipitabitur mors, et salus erit indefectiva, anxietas nulla jucunditas beata, societas dulcis et decora.	“Do earnestly what thou dost; labour faithfully in My vineyard; I will be thy reward. Write, read, sing, weep, be silent, pray, endure adversities manfully; eternal life is worthy of all these conflicts, yea, and of greater. Peace shall come in one day which is known to the Lord; which shall be neither day nor night, but light eternal, infinite clearness, steadfast peace, and undisturbed rest. Thou shalt not say then, Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? nor cry out, Woe is me, for my sojourning is prolonged , because death will be utterly destroyed, and there shall be salvation which can never fail, no more anxiety, happy delight, sweet and noble society.
466	3	III.243	243	O, si vidisses Sanctorum in cælo coronas perpetuas, quanta quoque nunc exultant gloria, qui huic mundo olim contemtibiles, et quasi vita ipsa indigni putabantur: profecto statim te humiliares usque ad terram et affectares potius omnibus subesse, quam uni præesse; nec hujus vitæ lætos dies concupisceres, sed magis pro Deo tribulari gauderes, et pro nihilo inter homines computari maximum lucrum duceres.	“Oh, if thou sawest the unfading crowns of the Saints in heaven, and with what great glory they now rejoice, who aforetime were reckoned by this world contemptibly and as it were unworthy of life, truly thou wouldst immediately humble thyself even to the earth, and wouldst desire rather to be in subjection to all, than to have authority over one; nor wouldst thou long for pleasant days of this life, but wouldst more rejoice to be afflicted for God’s sake, and wouldst esteem it gain to be counted for nought amongst men.
467	3	III.244	244	O, si tibi hæc saperent, et profunde ad cor transirent, quomodo auderes vel semel conqueri? Nonne pro vita æterna cuncta laboriosa sunt toleranda? Non est parvum quid lucrari, aut perdere regnum Dei. Leva igitur faciem tuam in cælo. Ecce ego et omnes Sancti mei mecum, qui in hoc sæculo magnum habuerunt certamen, modo gaudent modo consolantur modo securi sunt et modo requiescunt, et fine fine in regno Patris mei permanebunt mecum.	“Oh, if these things were sweet to thy taste, and moved thee to the bottom of thine heart, how shouldst thou dare even once to complain? Are not all laborious things to be endured for the sake of eternal life? It is no small thing, the losing or gaining the Kingdom of God. Lift up therefore thy face to heaven. Behold, I and all My Saints with Me, who in this world had a hard conflict, now rejoice, are now comforted, are now secure, are now at peace, and shall remain with Me evermore in the Kingdom of My Father.”

Dies semper læta, semper secura et nunquam statum mutans in contraria. O, utinam dies illa illuxisset, et cuncta hæc temporalia finem accepissent. Lucet quidem Sanctis perpetua claritate splendida, sed non nisi a longe per speculum peregrinanatibus in terra.	Oh most blessed mansion of the City which is above! Oh most clear day of eternity which the night obscureth not, but the Supreme Truth ever enlighteneth! Day always joyful, always secure and never changing its state into those which are contrary. Oh would that this day might shine forth, and that all these temporal things would come to an end. It shineth indeed upon the Saints, glowing with unending brightness, but only from afar and through a glass, upon those who are pilgrims on the earth.
470	3	III.247	247	Norunt cæli cives, quam gaudiosa sit illa; gemunt exules filii Evæ quod amara et tædiosa sit ista.

The citizens of heaven know how glorious that day is; the exiled sons of Eve groan, because this is bitter and wearisome. The days of this life are few and evil, full of sorrows and straits, where man is defiled with many sins, ensnared with many passions, bound fast with many fears, wearied with many cares, distracted with many questionings, entangled with many vanities, compassed about with many errors, worn away with many labours, weighed down with temptations, enervated by pleasures, tormented by poverty.
471	3	III.248	248	O, qundo erit finis horum multorum laborum? Quando liberabor a misera servitute vitiorum? Quando memorabor, Domine, tui solius? Quando ad plenum lætabor in te? Quando ero sine omni impedimento in vera libertate, sine omni gravamine mentis, et corporis? Quando erit pax solida, pax imperturbabilis et secura pax intus et foris, pax ab omni parte firma? Jesu bone, quando stabo ad videndum te? Quando contemplabor regni tui gloriam? Quando eris mihi omnia in omnibus? O, quando ero tecum in regno tuo, quod præparasit dilectis tuis ab æterno? Relictus sum pauper et exul in terra hostili, ubi bella quotidiana et infortunia maxima.	Oh when shall there be an end of these evils? When shall I be delivered from the wretched slavery of my sins? When shall I be mindful, O Lord, of Thee alone? When shall I rejoice in Thee to the full? When shall I be in true liberty without any impediment, without any burden on mind or body? When shall there be solid peace, peace immovable and secure, peace within and without, peace firm on every side? Blessed Jesus, when shall I stand to behold Thee? When shall I gaze upon the glory of Thy kingdom? When shalt Thou be to me all in all? Oh when shall I be with Thee in Thy Kingdom which Thou hast prepared from the foundation of the world for them that love Thee? I am left destitute, an exile in a hostile land, where are daily wars and grievous misfortunes.
472	3	III.249	249	Consolare exilium meum, mitiga dolorem meum, quia ad te suspirat omne desiderium meum. Nam onus totum mihi est, quidquid hic mundus offert ad solatium, desidero te intime frui, sed nequeo apprehendere. Opto inhærere cælestibus, sed deprimunt res temporales, et immortificatæ passiones. Mente omnibus rebus superesse opto, carni autem invite subesse cogor. Sic ego infelix homo mecum pugno et factus sum mihimetipsi gravis, dum spiritus sursum, et caro quærit esse deorsum.	Console my exile, mitigate my sorrow, for towards Thee all my desire longeth. For all is to me a burden, whatsoever this world offereth for consolation. I yearn to enjoy Thee intimately, but I cannot attain unto it. I long to cleave to heavenly things, but temporal things and unmortified passions press me down. In my mind I would be above all things, but in my flesh I am unwillingly compelled to be beneath them. So, wretched man that I am, I fight with myself, and am made grievous even unto myself, while the spirit seeketh to be above and the flesh to be beneath.
473	3	III.250	250	O, quid intus patior, dum mente cælestia tracto et mox carnalium tentationum et cogitationum turba occurit oranti.Deus meus, ne elongeris a meneque declines in ira a servo tuo.Fulgura coruscationem tuam et dissipaeas,emitte safittas tuaset conturbentur omnes phantasiæ inimici. Recollige omnes sensus meo ad te; fac me oblivisci omnium mundanorum; da cito abjicere et contemnere phantasmata vitiorum. Succurre mihi, æterna Veritas, ut nulla me moveat vanitas. Adveni, cælestis suavitas, et fugiat a facie tua omnis impuritas. Ignosce quoque mihi, et misericorditer indulge, quoties præter te aliud in oratione revolvo. Confiteor etenim vere, quia valde distracte me habere consuevi. Nam ibi multoties non sum, ubi corporaliter sto, aut sedeo, sed ibi magis sum, ubi cogitationibus feror. Ibi sum, ubi cogitatio mea est; ubi est frequenter cogitatio mea, ibi est id quod amo. Hoc mihi cito occurrit, quod naturaliter delectat aut ex usu placet.	Oh how I suffer inwardly, while with the mind I discourse on heavenly things, and presently a crowd of carnal things rusheth upon me whilst I pray. My God, be not Thou far from me, nor depart in wrath from Thy servant. Cast forth Thy lightning and scatter them; send out Thine arrows, and let all delusions of my enemy be confounded. Recall my senses unto Thyself, cause me to forget all worldly things; grant me quickly to cast away and despise the imaginations of sin. Succour me, O Eternal Truth, that no vanity may move me. Come unto me, O Heavenly Sweetness, and let all impurity flee from before Thy face. Pardon me also, and of Thy mercy deal gently with me, whensoever in prayer I think on anything besides Thee; for truly I confess that I am wont to be continually distracted. For often and often, where in the body I stand or sit, there I myself am not; but rather am I there, whither I am borne by my thoughts. Where my thought is, there am I; and there commonly is my thought where that which I love is. That readily occurreth to me, which naturally delighteth, or pleaseth through custom.
474	3	III.251	251	Unde tu, Veritas æterna, aperte dixisti:Ubi enim est thesaurus tuus, ibi est et cor tuum.Si cælum diligo, libenter de cælestibus penso. Si mundum amo, felicitatibus mundi congaudeo, et de adversitatibus ejus tristor. Si carnem diligo, quæ carnis sunt sæpissime imaginor. Si spiritum amo, de spiritualibus cogitare delector. Quæcumque enim diligo, de his libenter loquor et audio, atque talium imagines mecum ad domum reporto. Sed beatus ille homo qui propter te, Domine, omnibus creaturis abeundi licentiam tribuit, qui naturæ vim facit et concupiscentias carnis fervore spiritus crucifigit, ut serenata conscientia, puram tibi orationem offerat, dignusque sit angelicis interesse choris, omnibus terrenis foris et intus exclusis.	Wherefore Thou, who art the Truth, hast plainly said, Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. If I love heaven, I gladly meditate on heavenly things. If I love the world, I rejoice in the delights of the world, and am made sorry by its adversities. If I love the flesh, I am continually imagining the things which belong to the flesh; if I love the spirit, I am delighted by meditating on spiritual things. For whatsoever things I love, on these I readily converse and listen, and carry home with me the images of them. But blessed is that man who for Thy sake, O Lord, is willing to part from all creatures; who doth violence to his fleshly nature and crucifieth the lusts of the flesh by the fervour of his spirit, so that with serene conscience he may offer unto Thee a pure prayer, and be made worthy to enter into the angelic choirs, having shut out from himself, both outwardly and inwardly, all worldly things.
475	3	III.252	252	De desiderio æternæ vitæ, et quanta sint certantibus præmia promissa.	XLIX Of the desire after eternal life, and how great blessings are promised to those who strive
476	3	III.253	253	Fili mi, cum tibi desiderium æternæ beatitudinis desuper infundi sentis, et de tabernaculo corporis exire concupiscis, ut claritatem meam sine vicissitudinis umbra contemplari possis, dilata cor tuum, et omni desiderio hanc sanctam inspirationem suscipe. Redde amplissimas supernæ bonitati gratias, quæ tecum sic dignanter agit, clementer visitat, ardenter excitat, potenter sublevat, ne proprio pondere ad terrena labaris. Neque enim hoc cogitatu tuo aut conatu accipis, sed sola dignatione supernæ gratiæ et divini respectus, quatenus in virtutibus, et majori humilitate proficias et ad futura certamina te præpares mihique toto cordis affectu adhærere et serventi voluntate studeas deservire.	“My Son, when thou feelest the desire of eternal happiness to be poured into thee from above, and longest to depart from the tabernacle of this body, that thou mayest contemplate My glory without shadow of turning, enlarge thine heart, and take in this holy inspiration with all thy desire. Give most hearty thanks to the Supreme Goodness, who dealeth with thee so graciously, visiteth thee so lovingly, stirreth thee up so fervently, raiseth thee so powerfully, lest thou sink down through thine own weight, to earthly things. For not by thine own meditating or striving dost thou receive this gift, but by the sole gracious condescension of Supreme Grace and Divine regard; to the end that thou mayest make progress in virtue and in more humility, and prepare thyself for future conflicts, and cleave unto Me with all the affection of thy heart, and strive to serve Me with fervent will.
477	3	III.254	254	Fili, sæpe ignis ardet, sed sine fumo flamma non ascendit. Sic et aliquorum desideria ad cælestia flagrant et tamen a tentatione carnalis affectus liberi non sunt. Idcirco nec omnino pure pro honore Dei agunt quod tam desideranter ab eo petunt. Tale est et sæpe desiderium tuum, quod insinuasti fore tam importunum. Non enim est hoc purum et perfectum, quod propria commoditate est infectum.	“My Son, often the fire burneth, but the flame ascendeth not without smoke. So also the desires of some men burn towards heavenly things, and yet they are not free from the temptation of carnal affection. Thus therefore they are not acting with an altogether simple desire for God’s glory when they pray to Him so earnestly. Such, too, is oftentimes thy desire, when thou hast imagined it to be so earnest. For that is not pure and perfect which is tainted with thine own self-seeking.
478	3	III.255	255	Pete non quod tibi est delectabile et commodum, sed quod mihi acceptabile atque honorificum; quia si recte judicas meam ordinationem tuo desiderio, et omni desiderato præferre debes, ac sequi. Novi desiderium tuum, et frequentes gemitus audivi. Jam velles esse in libertate gloriæ filiorum Dei, jam te delectat domus æterna, et cælestis patria gaudio plena. Sed nondum venit hora ista; sed est adhuc, est aliud temus belli, videlicet tempus laboris et robatinis. Optas summo repleri bono, sed non potes hoc assequi modo. Ego sum, exspecta me, dicit Dominus, donec veniat regnum Dei.	“Seek thou not what is pleasant and advantageous to thyself, but what is acceptable and honourable unto Me; for if thou judgest rightly, thou must choose and follow after My appointment rather than thine own desire; yea, rather than anything that can be desired. I know thy desire, and I have heard thy many groanings. Already thou longest to be in the glorious liberty of the children of God; already the eternal home delighteth thee, and the heavenly country full of joy; but the hour is not yet come; there remaineth still another season, even a season of warfare, a season of labour and probation. Thou desirest to be filled with the Chief Good, but thou canst not attain it immediately. I AM that Good; wait for Me, until the Kingdom of God shall come.
479	3	III.256	256	Probandus es adhuc in terris et in multis exercitandus. Consolatio interdum tibi dabitur, sed copiosa satietas non concedetur. Confortare igitur et esto robustus, tam in agendo quam in patiendo naturæ contraria. Oportet te novum induere hominem, et in alterum virum mutari. Oportet te sæpe agere quod non vis, et quod vis oportet te relinquere. Quod aliis placet, processum habebit; quod tibi placet, ultra non proficiet. Quod alii dicunt, audietur; quod tu dicis, pro nihilo computabitur. Patent alii, et accipient; tu petes nec impetrabis.	“Thou must still be tried upon earth, and be exercised in many things. Consolation shall from time to time be given thee, but abundant satisfying shall not be granted. Be strong therefore, and be thou brave both in working and in suffering things which are against thy nature. Thou must put on the new man, and be changed into another man. Thou must often do what thou wouldst not; and thou must leave undone what thou wouldst do. What pleaseth others shall have good success, what pleaseth thee shall have no prosperity. What others say shall be listened to; what thou sayest shall receive no heed. Others shall ask and receive; thou shalt ask and not obtain.
480	3	III.257	257	Erunt alii magni in ore hominum; de te autem tacebitur. Aliis hoc vel illud committetur, tu autem ad nihil utilis judicaberis. Nam propter alium natura contristabitur, sed magnum fructum sibi silens reportabit. In his et similibus multis probari solet fidelis Domini servus, qualiter se in omnibus abnegare, et in omnibus frangere quærit. Vix est aliquid tale, in quo tantundem mori indiges, sicut videre et pati, quæ voluntati tuæ adversa sunt; maxime autem cum disconvenientia, et quæ minus tibi utilia apparent, fieri jubentur. Et quia non audes resistere altiori potestati, sub dominio constitutus, ideo durum tibi videtur ad nutum alterius ambulare, et omne proprium sentire omittere.	Others shall be great in the report of men, but about thee shall nothing be spoken. To others this or that shall be entrusted; thou shalt be judged useful for nought. “For this cause nature shall sometimes be filled with sadness; and it is a great thing if thou bear it silently. In this and many like things the faithful servant of the Lord is wont to be tried, how far he is able to deny himself and bring himself into subjection in all things. Scarcely is there anything in which thou hast need to mortify thyself so much as in seeing things which are adverse to thy will; especially when things are commanded thee to be done which seem to thee inexpedient or of little use to thee. And because thou darest not resist a higher power, being under authority, therefore it seemeth hard for thee to shape thy course according to the nod of another, and to forego thine own opinion.
481	3	III.258	258	Sed pensa, fili, horum fructum laborum, celerem finem atque præmium nimis magnum, et non habebis inde gravamen, sed fortissimum patientiæ tuæ solamen. Nam et pro modica hac voluntate, quam modo sponte deseris, habebis semper voluntatem tuam in cælis. Ibi quippe invenies omne quod volueris, omne quod desiderare potes. Ibi aderit tibi totius facultas boni sine timore amittendi. Ibi voluntas tua una semper mecum; nil cupies extraneum vel privatum. Ibi nullus resistet tibi, nemo de te conqueretur, nemo te impediet, nihil obviabit: sed cuncta desiderata simul erunt præsentia, totumque tuum affectum reficient, et adimplebunt usque ad summum. Ibi reddam gloriam pro contumelia perpessa, pallium laudis pro mærore, pro loco novissimo sedem regni in sæcula. Ibi apparebit fuctus obedientiæ; gaudebit labor pœitentiæ, et humilis subjectio coronabitur gloriose.	“But consider, My Son, the fruit of these labours, the swift end, and the reward exceeding great; and thou shalt find it no pain to bear them then, but rather the strongest solace of thy patience. For even in exchange for this trifling desire which thou hast readily forsaken, thou shalt always have thy will in Heaven. There verily thou shalt find all that thou wouldst, all that thou canst long for. There thou shalt have all good within thy power without the fear of losing it. There thy will, ever at one with Mine, shall desire nothing outward, nothing for itself. There no man shall withstand thee, none shall complain of thee, none shall hinder, nothing shall stand in thy path; but all things desired by thee shall be present together, and shall refresh thy whole affection, and fill it up even to the brim. There I will glory for the scorn suffered here, the garment of praise for sorrow, and for the lowest place a throne in the Kingdom, for ever. There shall appear the fruit of obedience, the labour of repentance shall rejoice, and humble subjection shall be crowned gloriously.
482	3	III.259	259	Nunc ergo te inclina humliter sub omnium manibus, nec sit curæ, quia hoc dixerit, ve jusserit: sed hoc magno opere curato, ut sive Prælatus, sive minor au æqualis aliud a te exposcerit vel innuerit, pro bono totum accipias, et sincera voluntate studeas adimplere. Quærat alius hoc, alius illud; glorietur ille in illo, et iste in isto; laudenturque millies mille, tu autem nec isto nec illo: sed tui ipsius gaude contemtu, et in mei solius beneplacito ac honore. Hoc optandum est tibi, ut sive per vitam sive per mortem Deus semper in te glorificetur.	“Now therefore bow thyself humbly under the hands of all men; nor let it trouble thee who said this or who ordered that; but take special heed that whether thy superior, thy inferior, or thy equal, require anything from thee, or even show a desire for it; take it all in good part, and study with a good will to fulfil the desire. Let one seek this, another that; let this man glory in this, and that man in that, and be praised a thousand thousand times, but rejoice thou only in the contempt of thyself, and in Mine own good pleasure and glory. This is what thou art to long for, even that whether by life or by death God may be ever magnified in thee.”
483	3	III.260	260	Qualiter homo defolatus debet se in manus Dei offerre.	L How a desolate man ought to commit himself into the hands of God
484	3	III.261	261	Domine Deus, sancte Pater, sis nunc et in æternum benedictus, quia sicut vis ita factum est, et quod facis bonum est. Lætetur in te servus tuus, non in se, nec in aliquo alio, quia tu solus lætitia vera, tu spes mea, et corona mea, tu gaudium meum, et honor meus, Domine. Quid habet servus tuus, nisi quod a te accepit, etiam sine merito suo? Tua sunt omnia, quæ dedisti et quæ fecisti.Pauper sum et in laboribus a juventute mea,et contristatur anima mea, nonnunquam usque ad lacrymas, quandoque etiam conturbatur spiritus meus a se propter imminentes passiones.	O Lord, Holy Father, be Thou blessed now and evermore; because as Thou wilt so it is done, and what Thou doest is good. Let Thy servant rejoice in Thee, not in himself, nor in any other; because Thou alone art the true joy, Thou art my hope and my crown, Thou art my joy and my honour, O Lord. What hath Thy servant, which he received not from Thee, even without merit of his own? Thine are all things which Thou hast given, and which Thou hast made. I am poor and in misery even from my youth up, and my soul is sorrowful unto tears, sometimes also it is disquieted within itself, because of the sufferings which are coming upon it.
485	3	III.262	262	Desidero pacis agudium, filiorum tuorum pacis flagito, qui in lumine consolationis a te pascuntur. Si das pacem, si gaudium sanctum infundis, erit anima servi tui plena modulatione, et devota in laude tua. Sed si te subtraxeris sicut sæpissime soles, non poterit currere viam mandatorum tuorum, sed magis ad tundendum pectus genua incurvantur, quia non est illi sicut heri, et nudiustertius, quando lucebat lucerna tua super caput ejus, et sub umbra alarum tuarum protegebatur a tentationibus irruentibus.	I long after the joy of peace; for the peace of Thy children do I beseech, for in the light of Thy comfort they are fed by Thee. If Thou give peace, if Thou pour into me holy joy, the soul of Thy servant shall be full of melody, and devout in Thy praise. But if Thou withdraw Thyself as too often Thou art wont, he will not be able to run in the way of Thy commandments, but rather he will smite his breast and will bow his knees; because it is not with him as yesterday and the day before, when Thy candle shined upon his head , and he walked under the shadow of Thy wings , from the temptations which beset him.
486	3	III.263	263	Pater juste, et semper laudande, venit hora, ut probetur servus tuus. Pater amande, dignum est, ut hora hac patiatur pro te aliquid servus tuus. Pater perpetuo venerande, venit hora quam ab æterno præsciebas affuturam, ut ad modicum tempus succumbat foris servus tuus; vivat vero semper apud te intus, paululum vilipendatur, humilietur et deficiet coram hominibus, passionibus conteratur et languoribus, ut iterum tecum in aurora lucis novæ resurgat, et in cælestibus clarificetur. Pater sancte, tu sic ordinasti, et sic voluisti, et hoc factum est quod præcepisti.	O Father, righteous and ever to be praised, the hour cometh when Thy servant is to be proved. O beloved Father, it is well that in this hour Thy servant suffer somewhat for Thy sake. O Father, evermore to be adored, as the hour cometh which Thou foreknewest from everlasting, when for a little while Thy servant should outwardly bow down, but always live inwardly with Thee; when for a little while he should be little regarded, humbled, and fail in the eyes of men; should be wasted with sufferings and weaknesses, to rise again with Thee in the dawn of the new light, and be glorified in the heavenly places. O Holy Father, thou hast ordained it so, and so hast willed it; and that is done which Thou Thyself hast commanded.
487	3	III.264	264	Est hæc enim gratia ad amicum tuum, pati et tribulari in mundo pro amore to, quotiescumque et a quocumque et quomodocumque id permiseris fieri. Sine consilio et providentia tua, et sine causa nihil fit in terra.Bonum mihi,Domine,quod humiliasti me ut discam justificationes tuas,et omnes elatines cordis atque præsumtiones abjiciam. Utile michi, quod confusio cooperuit faciem meam, ut te potius quam homines ad consolandum requiram. Didici etiam ex hoc inscrutabile judicium tuum expavescere, qui affligis justum cum impio, sed non sine æquitate et justitia.	For this is Thy favour to Thy friend, that he should suffer and be troubled in the world for Thy love’s sake, how often soever, and by whomsoever and whosoever Thou hast suffered it to be done. Without Thy counsel and providence, and without cause, nothing cometh to pass on the earth. It is good for me, Lord, that I had been in trouble, that I may learn Thy statutes, and may cast away all pride of heart and presumption. It is profitable for me that confusion hath covered my face, that I may seek to Thee for consolation rather than unto men. By this also I have learned to dread Thine unsearchable judgment, who afflictest the just with the wicked, but not without equity and justice.
488	3	III.265	265	Gratias tibi, quia non pepercisti malis meis, sed attrivisti me verberibus amaris, infligens dolores et immittens angustias foris et intus. Non est qui me consoletur ex omnibus quæsub cælo sunt, nisi tu, Domine Deus meus, cælestis medicus animarum, quipercutis et sanas, deducis ad inferos et reducis.Disciplina tua super me et virga tua ipsa me docebit.	Thanks be unto Thee, because Thou hast not spared my sins, but hast beaten me with stripes of love, inflicting pains, and sending troubles upon me without and within. There is none who can console me, of all things which are under heaven, but Thou only, O Lord my God, Thou heavenly Physician of souls, who dost scourge and hast mercy, who leadest down to hell and bringest up again. Thy discipline over me, and Thy rod itself shall teach me.
489	3	III.266	266	Ecce, Pater dilecte, in manibus tuis ego sum; sub virga correctionis tuæ me inclino: percute dorsum meum et collum meum, ut incurvem ad voluntatem tuam tortuositatem meam. Fac me pium et humilem discipulum, sicut bene facere consuevisti, ut ambulem ad omnem nutum tuum. Tibi me et omnia mea ad corrigendum committo: melius est hic corripi quam in futuro. Tu scis omnia et singula, et nihil te latet in humana conscientia. Antequam fiant, nosti ventura, et non opus tibi est ut quis te doceat aut admoneat de his quæ fiunt in terra. Tu scis quid expediat ad profectum meum et quantum deservit tribulatio ad rubiginem vitiorum purgandum. Fac mecum desideratum beneplacitum tuum et ne despicias peccaminosam vitam meam, nulli melius et clarius quam tibi soli notam.	Behold, O beloved Father, I am in Thy hands, I bow myself under the rod of Thy correction. Smite my back and my neck that I may bend my crookedness to Thy will. Make me a pious and lowly disciple, as Thou wert wont to be kind, that I may walk according to every nod of Thine. To Thee I commend myself and all that I have for correction; better is it to be punished here than hereafter. Thou knowest all things and each of them; and nothing remaineth hid from Thee in man’s conscience. Before they are, thou knowest that they will be, and Thou needest not that any man teach Thee or admonish Thee concerning the things which are done upon the earth. Thou knowest what is expedient for my profit, and how greatly trouble serveth unto the scrubbing off the rust of sin. Do with me according to Thy desired good pleasure, and despise not my life which is full of sin, known to none so entirely and fully as to Thee alone.
490	3	III.267	267	Da mihi, Domine, scire quod sciendum est, hoc amare quod amandum est, hoc laudare quod tibi summe placet, hoc reputare quod tibi prætiosum apparet, hoc vituperare quod tibi sordescit. Non me sinas secundam visionem oculorum exteriorum judicare, neque secundum auditum aurium hominum imperitorum sententiare: sed in judicio vero de visibilibus et spiritualibus discernere atque super omnia voluntatem beneplaciti tui semper inquirere.	Grant me, O Lord, to know that which ought to be known; to love that which ought to be loved; to praise that which pleaseth Thee most, to esteem that which is precious in Thy sight, to blame that which is vile in Thine eyes. Suffer me not to judge according to the sight of bodily eyes, nor to give sentence according to the hearing of the ears of ignorant men; but to discern in true judgment between visible and spiritual things, and above all things to be ever seeking after the will of Thy good pleasure.
491	3	III.268	268	Falluntur sæpe hominum sensus in judicando; falluntur et amatores sæculi visibilia tantummodo amando. Quid enim homo inde melior, quia reputabitur ab homine major? Fallax fallacem, vanus vanum, cæcus cæcum, infirmus infirmum decipit, dum exaltat et veraciter magis confundit, dum inaniter laudat. Nam quantum unusquisque est in oculis tuis, tantum est et non amplius, ait humilis sanctus Franciscus.	Oftentimes the senses of men are deceived in judging; the lovers of the world also are deceived in that they love only visible things. What is a man better because by man he is reckoned very great? The deceiver deceiveth the deceiver, the vain man the vain, the blind man the blind, the weak man the weak, when they exalt one another; and in truth they rather put to shame, while they foolishly praise. For as humble St. Francis saith, “What each one is in Thine eyes, so much he is, and no more.”
492	3	III.269	269	Quod humilibus insistendum est operibus, cum deficitur a summis.	LI That we must give ourselves to humble works when we are unequal to those that are lofty
493	3	III.270	270	Fili mi, non semper vales in serventiori desiderio virtutum stare nec in altiori gradu contemplationis, sed necesse habes interdum ob originalem corruptelam ad inferiora descendere, et onus corruptibilis vitæ etiam invite et cum tædio portare. Quamdiu mortale corpus geris, tædium senties et gravamen cordis. Oportet ergo sæpe in carne de carnis onere gemere, eo guod non vales spiritualibus studiis, et divinæ contemplationi indefinenter inhærere.	“My Son, thou art not always able to continue in very fervent desire after virtues, nor to stand fast in the loftier region of contemplation; but thou must of necessity sometimes descend to lower things because of thine original corruption, and bear about the burden of corruptible life, though unwillingly and with weariness. So long as thou wearest a mortal body, thou shalt feel weariness and heaviness of heart. Therefore thou oughtest to groan often in the flesh because of the burden of the flesh, inasmuch as thou canst not give thyself to spiritual studies and divine contemplation unceasingly.
494	3	III.271	271	Tunc expedit tibi ad humilia et exteriora opera confugere, et in bonis te actibus recreare, adventum meum et supernam visitationem firma confidentia exspectare, exilium tuum et ariditatem mentis patienter sufferre, donec iterum a me visiteris, et ab omnibus anxietatibus libereris. Nam faciam te laborum oblivisci, et interna quiete perfrui. Expandam coram te prata scripturarum, ut dilatato corde currere incipas viam mandatorum emorum, et dices:Non sunt condignaæ passiones hujus temproris ad futuram gloriam quæ revelabitur in nobis.	“At such a time it is expedient for thee to flee to humble and external works, and to renew thyself with good actions; to wait for My coming and heavenly visitation with sure confidence; to bear thy exile and drought of mind with patience, until thou be visited by Me again, and be freed from all anxieties. For I will cause thee to forget thy labours, and altogether to enjoy eternal peace. I will spread open before thee the pleasant pastures of the Scriptures, that with enlarged heart thou mayest begin to run in the way of My commandments. And thou shalt say, ‘The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.’”
495	3	III.272	272	Quod homo non reputet se consolatione dignum, sed magis verberibus dignum.	LII That a man ought not to reckon himself worthy of consolation, but more worthy of chastisement
496	3	III.273	273	Domine, non sum dignus consolatione tua, nec aliqua spirituali visitatione: et ideo juste mecum agis, quando me inopem et desolatum relinquis. Si enim ad instar maris lacrymas fundere possem, adhuc consolatione tua dignus non essem. Unde nihil dignus sum quam flagellari et puniri, quia graviter et sæpe te offendi, et in multis valde deliqui. Ergo vera pensata ratione, nec minima sum dignus consolatione. Sed tu clemens et misericors, quia non vis perire opera tua, ad ostendendum divitias bonitatis tuæ in vasa misericordiæ tuæ, etiam propter omne proprium meritum dignaris consolari servum tuum supra humanum modum. Tuæ enim consolationes non sunt sicut humanæ confabulationes.	O Lord, I am not worthy of Thy consolation, nor of any spiritual visitation; and therefore Thou dealest justly with me, when Thou leavest me poor and desolate. For if I were able to pour forth tears like the sea, still should I not be worthy of Thy consolation. Therefore am I nothing worthy save to be scourged and punished, because I have grievously and many a time offended Thee, and in many things have greatly sinned. Therefore, true account being taken, I am not worthy even of the least of Thy consolations. But Thou, gracious and merciful God, who willest not that Thy works should perish, to show forth the riches of Thy mercy upon the vessels of mercy, vouchsafest even beyond all his own deserving, to comfort Thy servant above the measure of mankind. For Thy consolations are not like unto the discoursings of men.
497	3	III.274	274	Quid egi, Domine, ut mihi conferres aliquam cælestem consolationem? Ego nihil boni egisse recolo me, sed semper ad vitia pronum, et ad emendationem pigrum fuisse. Verum est, et abnegare non possum; si aliter dicerem, tu stares contra me, et non esset qui defenderet. Quid merui pro peccatis meis, nisi infernum, et ignem æternum? In veritate confiteor, quoniam dignus sum omni ludibrio et contemtu; nec decet me inter devotos tuos commarari. Et licet hoc ægre audiam, tamen adversum me pro veritate peccata mea arguam, ut facilius misericordiam tuam valeam impetrare.	What have I done, O Lord, that Thou shouldst bestow any heavenly comfort upon me? I remember not that I have done any good, but have been ever prone to sin and slow to amendment. It is true and I cannot deny it. If I should say otherwise, Thou wouldst rise up against me, and there would be none to defend me. What have I deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire? In very truth I confess that I am worthy of all scorn and contempt, nor is it fit that I should be remembered among Thy faithful servants. And although I be unwilling to hear this, nevertheless I will for the Truth’s sake, accuse myself of my sins, that the more readily I may prevail to be accounted worthy of Thy mercy.
498	3	III.275	275	Quid dicam reus, et omni confusione plenus? Non habeo os loquendi, nisi hoc tantum verbum: Peccavi, Domine, peccavi: miserere mei, ignosce mihi.Sine me paululum, ut plangam dolorem meum, antequam vadam ad terram tenebrosam, et opertam mortis caligine.Quid tam maxime a reo et misero peccatore requiris nisi ut conteratur et humiliet se pro delictis suis? In vera contritione, et cordis humiliatione nascitur spes veniæ, reconciliatur perturbata conscientia, recuperatur gratia perdita, tuetur homo a futura ira, et occurrunt sibi mutuo in osculo sancto Deus et pœnitens anima.	What shall I say, guilty that I am and filled with confusion? I have no mouth to utter, unless it be this word alone, “I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned; have mercy upon me, forgive me.” Let me alone, that I may take comfort a little before I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death. What dost Thou so much require of a guilty and miserable sinner, as that he be contrite, and humble himself for his sins? In true contrition and humiliation of heart is begotten the hope of pardon, the troubled conscience is reconciled, lost grace is recovered, a man is preserved from the wrath to come, and God and the penitent soul hasten to meet each other with a holy kiss.
499	3	III.276	276	Humilis peccatorum contritio acceptabile tibi est, Domine, sacrificium, longe suavius odorans in conspectu tuo, quam thuris incesum. Hoc est gratum etiam unguentum, quod sacris pedibus tuis infundi volusti, quiacor contritum, et humiliatum nunquam despexisti.Ibi est locus refugii a facie iræ inimici; ibi emendatur et abluitur quidquid aliunde contractum est in inquinatum.	The humble contrition of sinners is an acceptable sacrifice unto Thee, O Lord, sending forth a smell sweeter far in Thy sight than the incense. This also is that pleasant ointment which Thou wouldst have poured upon Thy sacred feet, for a broken and contrite heart Thou hast never despised. There is the place of refuge from the wrathful countenance of the enemy. There is amended and washed away whatsoever evil hath elsewhere been contracted.
500	3	III.277	277	De gratia quæ non miscetur terrena sapientibus.	LIII That the Grace of God doth not join itself to those who mind earthly things
501	3	III.278	278	Fili, prætiosa est gratia mea, non patitur se misceri extraneis rebus, nec consolationibus terrenis. Abjicere ergo oportet omnia impedimenta gratiæ, si optas ejus infusionem suscipere. Pete secretum tibi; ama solus habitare tecum, nullius require confabulatinem, sed magis ad Deum devotam effunde precem, ut devotam teneas mentem, et puram conscientiam. Totum mundum nihil exstima, Dei vacationem omnibus exterioribus antepone. Non enim poteris mihi vacare et in transitoriis pariter delectari. A notis et a charis oportet elongari et ab omni temporali solatio mentem tenere privatam. Sic obsecrat beatus Apostolus Petrus, ut tanquam advenas et peregrinos in hoc mundo se contineant Christi fideles.	“My Son, precious is My grace, it suffereth not itself to be joined with outward things, nor with earthly consolations. Therefore thou oughtest to cast away all things which hinder grace, if thou longest to receive the inpouring thereof. Seek a secret place for thyself, love to dwell alone with thyself, desire the conversation of no one; but rather pour out thy devout prayer to God, that thou mayest possess a contrite mind and a pure conscience. Count the whole world as nought; seek to be alone with God before all outward things. For thou canst not be alone with Me, and at the same time be delighted with transitory things. Thou oughtest to be separated from thy acquaintances and dear friends, and keep thy mind free from all worldly comfort. So the blessed Apostle Peter beseecheth, that Christ’s faithful ones bear themselves in this world as strangers and pilgrims.
502	3	III.279	279	O, quanta fiducia erit morituro, quem nullius rei affectus detinet in mundo. Sed sic segregatum cor habere in omnibus, æger necdum capit animus, nec animalis homo novit interni hominis libertatem. Attamen si vere velit esse spiritualis, oportet eum renuntiare tam remotis, quam propinquis, et a nemine magis cavere, quam a se ipso. Si te ipsum perfecte viceris, cætera facilis subjugabis. Perfecta namque victoria est de semetipso triumphare: qui enim semetipsum subjectum tenet, ut sensualitas rationi, et ratio in cunctis obediat mihi, hic vere victor sui est et dominus mundi.	“Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world? But to have a heart so separated from all things, a sickly soul doth not yet comprehend, nor doth the carnal man know the liberty of the spiritual man. But if indeed he desire to be spiritually minded, he must renounce both those who are far off, and those who are near, and to beware of no man more than himself. If thou perfectly conquer thyself, very easily shalt thou subdue all things besides. Perfect victory is the triumph over oneself. For whoso keepeth himself in subjection, in such manner that the sensual affections obey the reason, and the reason in all things obeyeth Me, he truly is conqueror of himself, and lord of the world.
503	3	III.280	280	Si ad hunc apicem scandere gliscis, oportet viriliter incipere et securim ad radicem ponere, ut evellas et destruas occultam in inordinatam inclinationem ad te ipsum et ad omne privatum inclinationem ad te ipsum et ad omne privatum et materiale bonum. Ex hoc vitio quod homo semetipsum nimis inordinate diligit, pene totum pendet quidquid radicaliter vincendum est, quo devicto et subacto malo, pax magna et tranquillitas erit continuo. Sed quia pauci sibi ipsi mori perfecte laborant, nec plene extra se tendunt, propterea in se implicati remanent, nec supra se elevari in spiritu possunt. Qui autem libere mecum ambulare desiderat, necesse est, ut omnes pravas et inordinatas affectiones suas mortificet atque nulli creaturæ privato amore concupiscenter inhæreat.	“If thou desire to climb to this height, thou oughtest to start bravely, and to lay the axe to the root, to the end that thou mayest pull up and destroy the hidden inordinate inclination towards thyself, and towards all selfish and earthly good. From this sin, that a man loveth himself too inordinately, almost everything hangeth which needeth to be utterly overcome: when that evil is conquered and put under foot, there shall be great peace and tranquillity continually. But because few strive earnestly to die perfectly to themselves, and do not heartily go forth from themselves, therefore do they remain entangled in themselves, and cannot be raised in spirit above themselves. But he who desireth to walk at liberty with Me, must of necessity mortify all his evil and inordinate affections, and must cling to no creature with selfish love.”
504	3	III.281	281	De diversis motibus naturæ et gratiæ.	LIV Of the diverse motions of Nature and of Grace
505	3	III.282	282	Fili, diligenter adverte motus naturæ et gratiæ: quia valde contrarie et subtiliter moventur, et vix nisi a spirituali et intime illuminato homine discernuntur. Omnes quidem bonum appetunt, et aliquid boni in suis dictis vel factis prætendunt: ideo sub specie boni multi saluntur.	“My Son, pay diligent heed to the motions of Nature and of Grace, because they move in a very contrary and subtle manner, and are hardly distinguished save by a spiritual and inwardly enlightened man. All men indeed seek good, and make pretence of something good in all that they say or do; and thus under the appearance of good many are deceived.
506	3	III.283	283	Natura callida est et multos trahit, illaqueat, et decipit, et se semper pro fine habet. Sed gratia simpliciter ambulat, et ab omni specie mala decinat, fallacias non prætendit, et omnia pure propter Deum agit, in quo et finaliter requiescit.	“Nature is deceitful and draweth away, ensnareth, and deceiveth many, and always hath self for her end; but Grace walketh in simplicity and turneth away from every appearance of evil, maketh no false pretences, and doeth all entirely for the sake of God, in whom also she finally resteth.
507	3	III.284	284	Natura invite vult mori, nec premi nec superari vult, nec subesee nec sponte subjugari. Gratia vero studet mortificationi propriæ, resistit sensualitati, quærit subjici, appetit vinci, nec propria vult libertate fungi, sub disciplina amat teneri, nec alicui cupit dominari: sed sub Dei semper vivere, stare et esse, atque propter Deum omni humanæ creaturæ humiliter parata est inclinari.	“Nature is very unwilling to die, and to be pressed down, and to be overcome, and to be in subjection, and to bear the yoke readily; but Grace studieth self-mortification, resisteth sensuality, seeketh to be subdued, longeth to be conquered, and willeth not to use her own liberty. She loveth to be held by discipline, and not to have authority over any, but always to live, to remain, to have her being under God, and for God’s sake is ready to be humbly subject to every ordinance of man.
508	3	III.285	285	Natura pro suo commodo laborat, et quidquid lucri sibi et alio proveniat attendit. Gratia autem non quid sibi utile et commodum sit, sed quod multis proficiat, magis considerat.	“Nature laboureth for her own advantage, and considereth what profit she may gain from another; but Grace considereth more, not what may be useful and convenient to self, but what may be profitable to the many.
509	3	III.286	286	Natura libenter honorem accipit et reverentiam. Gratia vero omnem honoem, et gloriam Deo fideliter attribuit.	“Nature willingly receiveth honour and reverence; but Grace faithfully ascribeth all honour and glory to God.
510	3	III.287	287	Natura confusionem timet et contemtum. Grata autem gaudet pro nomine Jesu contumeliam pati.	“Nature feareth confusion and contempt, but Grace rejoiceth to suffer shame for the name of Jesus.
511	3	III.288	288	Natura otium amat, et quietem corporalem. Gratia vero vacua esse non potest, sed libenter amplectitur laborem.	“Nature loveth ease and bodily quiet; Grace cannot be unemployed, but gladly embraceth labour.
512	3	III.289	289	Natural quærit curiosa habere et pulchra, et abhorret vilia, et grossa. Gratia vero simplicibus delectatur et humilibus; aspera non aspernatur, nec vetustis refugit indui pannis.	“Nature seeketh to possess things curious and attractive, and abhorreth those which are rough and cheap; Grace is delighted with things simple and humble, despiseth not those which are rough, nor refuseth to be clothed with old garments.
513	3	III.290	290	Natura respicit temporalia, gaudet ad lucra terrena, tristatur de damno, irritatur de levi injuriæ verbo. Sed gratia attendit æterna, non inhæret temporalibus, nec in perditione rerum turbatur, neque verbis durioribus acerbatur, quia thesaurum suum et gaudium in cælo, ubi nihil perit, constituit.	“Nature hath regard to things temporal, rejoiceth in earthly lucre, is made sad by loss, vexed by any little injurious word; but Grace reacheth after things eternal, cleaveth not to those which are temporal, is not perturbed by losses, nor embittered by any hard words, because she hath placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nought perisheth.
514	3	III.291	291	Natura cupida est, et libentius accipit quam donat; amat propria et privata. Gratia autem pia est et communis, vitat singularia, contentatur paucis, beatius judicat dare quam accipere.	“Nature is covetous, and receiveth more willingly than she giveth, loveth things that are personal and private to herself; while Grace is kind and generous, avoideth selfishness, is contented with a little, believeth that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
515	3	III.292	292	Natura inclinat ad creaturas ad carnem propriam, ad vanitatem, et discursus. Sed gratia trahit ad Deum, et ad virtutes, renuntiat creaturis, fugit mundum, odit carnis desideria, restringit evagationes, erubescit in publico apparere.	“Nature inclineth thee to created things, to thine own flesh, to vanities and dissipation; but Grace draweth to God and to virtues, renounceth creatures, fleeth from the world, hateth the desires of the flesh, restraineth vagaries, blusheth to be seen in public.
516	3	III.293	293	Natura aliquod solatium libenter habet externum, in quo delectetur ad sensum. Sed gratia in solo Deo quærit consolari, et in summo bono super omnia visiblia delectari.	“Nature is glad to receive some outward solace in which the senses may have delight; but Grace seeketh to be comforted in God alone, and to have delight in the chief good above all visible things.
517	3	III.294	294	Natura totum agit propter lucrum, et commodum proprium, nihil gratis facere otest: sed aut æquale, aut melius, aut laudem, aut favorem pro benefactis consequi speart et multum ponderari sua gesta et dona et dicta concupiscit. Gratia vero nihil temporale quærit, nec aliud præmium quam Deum solum pro mercede postulat, nec amplius de temporalibus necessariis desiderat, nisi quantum hæc sibi ad affecutionem æternorum valeant deservire.	“Nature doeth everything for her own gain and profit, can do nothing as a free favour, but hopeth to attain something as good or better, or some praise or favour for her benefits; and she loveth that her own deeds and gifts should be highly valued; but Grace seeketh nothing temporal, nor requireth any other gift of reward than God alone; neither longeth she for more of temporal necessities than such as may suffice for the attaining of eternal life.
518	3	III.295	295	Natura gaudet de amicis multis et propinquis, gloriatur de nobili loco, et ortu generis; arridet potentibus, blanditur divitibus, applaudit sibi similibus. Gratia autem etiam inimicos diligit, nec de amicorum turba extollitur, nec locum, nec ortum natalium reputat, nisi ubi virtus major fuerit, favet magis pauperi quam diviti, compatitur plus innocenti quam potenti, congaudet veraci et non fallaci, exhortatur semper bonos meliora charismata æmulari, et Filio Dei per virtutes assimilari.	“Nature rejoiceth in many friends and kinsfolk, she boasteth of noble place and noble birth, she smileth on the powerful, flattereth the rich, applaudeth those who are like herself; but Grace loveth even her enemies, and is not lifted up by the multitude of friends, setteth no store upon high place or high birth, unless there be greater virtue therewith; favoureth the poor man more than the rich, hath more sympathy with the innocent than with the powerful; rejoiceth with the truthful, not with the liar; always exhorteth the good to strive after better gifts of grace, and to become by holiness like unto the Son of God.
519	3	III.296	296	Natura de defectu et molestia cito conqueritur. Gratia constanter fert inopiam.	“Nature quickly complaineth of poverty and of trouble; Grace beareth want with constancy.
520	3	III.297	297	Natura ad se omnia reflectit, pro se certat et arguit. Gratia autem ad Deum cuncta reducit, unde originaliter emanant, nihil boni sibi adscribit nec arroganter præsumit, non contendit, nec suam sententiam aliis præfert, sed in omni sensu, et intellectu æternæ sapientiæ ac divino examini se submittit.	“Nature looketh upon all things in reference to herself; striveth and argueth for self; but Grace bringeth back all things to God from whom they came at the beginning; ascribeth no good to herself nor arrogantly presumeth; is not contentious, nor preferreth her own opinion to others, but in every sense and understanding submitteth herself to the Eternal wisdom and the Divine judgment.
521	3	III.298	298	Natura appetit scire secreta, et nova audire; vult exterius apparere et multa per sensus experiri; desiderat agnosci, et agere unde laus et admiratio procedit. Sed gratia non curat nova nec curiosa percipere, quia totum hoc de vetustate corruptonis est ortum, cum nihil novum et durabile est super terram. Docet itaque sensus restringere, vanam complacentiam et ostentationem devitare, laudanda et digne miranda humiliter abscondere, et de omni re et de omni scientia utilitatis fructum, atque Dei laudem et honorem quærere. Non vult se nec sua prædicari; sed Deum in donis suis optat benedici, qui cuncta ex mera charitate largitur.	“Nature is eager to know secrets and to hear new things; she loveth to appear abroad, and to make experience of many things through the senses; she desireth to be acknowledged and to do those things which win praise and admiration; but Grace careth not to gather up new or curious things, because all this springeth from the old corruption, whereas there is nothing new or lasting upon earth. So she teacheth to restrain the senses, to shun vain complacency and ostentation, to hide humbly those things which merit praise and real admiration, and from everything and in all knowledge to seek after useful fruit, and the praise and honour of God. She desireth not to receive praise for herself or her own, but longeth that God be blessed in all His gifts, who out of unmingled love bestoweth all things.”
522	3	III.299	299	Hæc gratia supernaturale lumen, et quoddam Dei speciale donum est, et proprie electorum signaculum, et pignus salutis æternæ: quæ hominem de terrenis ad cælestia amanda sustollit, et de carnali spiritualem efficit. Quanto igitur natura amplius premitur, et vincitur, tanto major gratia infunditur, et quotidie novis visitationibus interior homo secundum imaginem Dei formatur.	This Grace is a supernatural light, and a certain special gift of God, and the proper mark of the elect, and the pledge of eternal salvation; it exalteth a man from earthly things to love those that are heavenly; and it maketh the carnal man spiritual. So far therefore as Nature is utterly pressed down and overcome, so far is greater Grace bestowed and the inner man is daily created anew by fresh visitations, after the image of God.
523	3	III.300	300	De corruptione naturæ, et efficacia gratiæ divinæ.	LV Of the corruption of Nature and the efficacy of Divine Grace
524	3	III.301	301	Domine Deus meus, qui me creasti ad imaginem et similitudinem tuam: concede mihi hanc gratiam, quam ostendisti mhi tam magnam et necessariam ad salutem, ut vincam pessimam naturam meam trahentem me ad peccata et in perditionem. Sentio enim in carne mea legem peccati, contradicentem legi mentis meæ, et captivum me ducentem ad obediendum sensualitati in multis, nec possum resistere passionibus ejus, nisi assistat tua sanctissima gratia, cordi meo ardenter infusa.	O Lord my God, who hast created me after thine own image and similitude, grant me this grace, which Thou hast shown to be so great and so necessary for salvation, that I may conquer my wicked nature, which draweth me to sin and to perdition. For I feel in my flesh the law of sin, contradicting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the obedience of sensuality in many things; nor can I resist its passions, unless Thy most holy grace assist me, fervently poured into my heart.
525	3	III.302	302	Opus est gratia tua et magna gratia, ut vincatur natura ad malum semper prona ab adolescentia sua. Nam per primum hominem Adam lapsa, et vitiata per peccatum, in omnes homines pœ hujus maculæ descendit, ut ipsa natura, quæ bene et recte a te condita fuit, pro vitio jam et infirmitate corruptæ naturæ ponatur, eo quod motus ejus, sibi relictus, ad malum et inferiora trahit. Nam modica vis, quæ remansit, est tamquam scintilla quædam latens in cinere. Hæc est ipsa caro naturalis, circumfusa magna caligine, adhuc judicium habens boni et mali, veri falsique distantiam, licet impotens sit adimplere omne quod probat, nec pleno jam lumine veritatis, nec sanitate affectionem suarum potiatur.	There is need of Thy grace, yea, and of a great measure thereof, that my nature may be conquered, which hath alway been prone to evil from my youth. For being fallen through the first man Adam, and corrupted through sin, the punishment of this stain descended upon all men; so that Nature itself, which was framed good and right by Thee, is now used to express the vice and infirmity of corrupted Nature; because its motion left unto itself draweth men away to evil and to lower things. For the little power which remaineth is as it were one spark lying hid in the ashes. This is Natural reason itself, encompassed with thick clouds, having yet a discernment of good and evil, a distinction of the true and the false, though it be powerless to fulfil all that it approveth, and possess not yet the full light of truth, nor healthfulness of its affections.
526	3	III.303	303	Hinc est, Deus meus, quodcondelector legi tuæ, secundum interiorem hominem, sciens mandatum tuum fore bonum, justum et sanctum, arguens etiam omne malum et peccatum fugiendum. Carni autem servio lege peccati, dum magis sensualitati obedio, quam rationi. Hinc est quod velle bonum mihi adjacet, perficere autem non invenio. Hin sæpe bona multa propono, sed quia gratia deest ad adjuvandam infirmitatem meam, ex levi resistentia exilio et deficio. Hinc accidit quod viam perfectorum agnosco, et qualiter agere debeam, satis clare video: sed propriæ corruptionis pondere pressus ad perfectiora non assurgo.	Hence it is, O my God, that I delight in Thy law after the inward man, knowing that Thy commandment is holy and just and good; reproving also all evil, and the sin that is to be avoided: yet with the flesh I serve the law of sin, whilst I obey sensuality rather than reason. Hence it is that to will to do good is present with me, but how to perform it I find not. Hence I ofttimes purpose many good things; but because grace is lacking to help mine infirmities, I fall back before a little resistance and fail. Hence it cometh to pass that I recognize the way of perfectness, and see very clearly what things I ought to do; but pressed down by the weight of my own corruption, I rise not to the things which are more perfect.
527	3	III.304	304	O, quam maxime est mihi necessaria gratia tua, Domine, ad inchoandum bonum, ad proficiendum et ad perficiendum. Nam sine te nihil possum facere; omnia autem possum in te, confortante me gratia tua. O, vere cælestis, gratia, sine qua nulla sunt propria merita, nulla quoque dona naturaæ ponderanda. Nihil artes, nihil divitiæ, nihil pulchritudo vel fortitudo, nihil igneium vel eloquentia valent apud te, Domine, sine gratia tua. Nam bona naturaæ bonis et malis sunt communia: Electorum autem proprium donum est gratia, sive dilectio, qua insigniti digni habenter vita æterna. Tantum eminet hæc gratia, ut nec donum prophetiæ, nec signorum operatio, nec quantalibet alta speculatio aliquid æstimetur sine ea. Sed neque fides neque spes neque aliæ virtutes sine charitate et gratia tibi acceptæ sunt.	Oh how entirely necessary is Thy grace to me, O Lord, for a good beginning, for progress, and for bringing to perfection. For without it I can do nothing, but I can do all things through Thy grace which strengtheneth me. O truly heavenly grace, without which our own merits are nought, and no gifts of Nature at all are to be esteemed. Arts, riches, beauty, strength, wit, eloquence, they all avail nothing before Thee, O Lord, without Thy grace. For the gifts of Nature belong to good and evil alike; but the proper gift of the elect is grace—that is, love—and they who bear the mark thereof are held worthy of everlasting life. So mighty is this grace, that without it neither the gift of prophecy nor the working of miracles, nor any speculation, howsoever lofty, is of any value at all. But neither faith, nor hope, nor any other virtue is accepted with Thee without love and grace.
528	3	III.305	305	O, beatissima gratia, quæ pauperem spiritu virtutibus divitem facis, et divitem multis bonis humilem corde reddis. Veni, descende ad me, reple me mane misericordia tua et consolatione tua, ne deficiat præ lassitudine et ariditate mentis anima mea. Obsecro, Domine, ut inveniam gratiam in oculis tuis: sufficit enim mihi gratia cæteris non obtentis quæ desiert natura. Si fuero vexatus et tentatus tribulationibus multis, non timebo mala, dum fuerit mecum gratia tua. Ipsa fortitudo mea, ipsa consilium confert et axilium. Cunctis hostibus potentior est et sapientior universis sapientibus.	O most blessed grace that makest the poor in spirit rich in virtues, and renderest him who is rich in many things humble in spirit, come Thou, descend upon me, fill me early with Thy consolation, lest my soul fail through weariness and drought of mind. I beseech thee, O Lord, that I may find grace in Thy sight, for Thy grace is sufficient for me, when I obtain not those things which Nature longeth for. If I be tempted and vexed with many tribulations, I will fear no evil, while Thy grace remaineth with me. This alone is my strength, this bringeth me counsel and help. It is more powerful than all enemies, and wiser than all the wise men in the world.
529	3	III.306	306	Magistra est veritatis, doctrix disciplinæ, lumen cordis, solamen pressuræ, fugatrix tristitiæ, ablatrix timoris, nutrix devotionis, productrix lacrymarum. Quid sum sine ea nisi aridum lignum et stips inutilis ad ejiciendum? Tua ergo, Domine, gratia me semper præbenitat, et sequatur ac bonis operibus jugiter præstet esse intentum per Jesum Christum Filium tuum. Amen.	It is the mistress of truth, the teacher of discipline, the light of the heart, the solace of anxiety, the banisher of sorrow, the deliverer from fear, the nurse of devotion, the drawer forth of tears. What am I without it, save a dry tree, a useless branch, worthy to be cast away! “Let Thy grace, therefore, O Lord, always prevent and follow me, and make me continually given to all good works, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son. Amen.”
530	3	III.307	307	Quod nosmetipsos abnegare et Christum imitari debemus per crucem.	LVI That we ought to deny ourselves, and to imitate Christ by means of the Cross
531	3	III.308	308	Fili, quantum vales a te exire, tantum in me poteris pertransire. Sicut nihil foris concupiscere internam pacem facit, sic se interius relinquere Deo conjungit. Volo te addiscere perfectam abnegationem tui in voluntate mea, sine contradictione et querela. Sequere me:Ego sum via, veritas, et vita.Sine via non itur; sine veritate non cognoscitur; sine vita non vivitur. Ego sum via, quam sequi debes, veritas, cui credere debes, vita, quam sperare debes. Ego sum via inviolabilis, veritas infallibilis, vita interminabilis. Ego sum via rectissima, veritas suprema, vita vera, vita beata, vita increata. Si maseris in via mea, cognosces veritatem, et veritas liberabit te et apprehendes vitram æternam.	My Son, so far as thou art able to go out of thyself so far shalt thou be able to enter into Me. As to desire no outward thing worketh internal peace, so the forsaking of self inwardly joineth unto God. I will that thou learn perfect self-denial, living in My will without contradiction or complaint. Follow Me: I am the way, the truth, and the life. Without the way thou canst not go, without the truth thou canst not know, without the life thou canst not live. I am the Way which thou oughtest to follow; the Truth which thou oughtest to believe; the Life which thou oughtest to hope for. I am the Way unchangeable; the Truth infallible; the Life everlasting. I am the Way altogether straight, the Truth supreme, the true Life, the blessed Life, the uncreated Life. If thou remain in My way thou shalt know the Truth, and the truth shall make thee free, and thou shalt lay hold on eternal life.
532	3	III.309	309	Si vis ad vitam ingredi, serva mandata.Si vis veritatem cognoscere, crede mihi.Si vis perfectus esse, vende omnia.Si vis esse discipulus meus, abnega temetipsum. Si vis beatam vitam possidere præsentem vitam contemne. Si vis exaltari in cælo, humilia te in mundo. Si vis regnare mecum, porta crecem mecum. Soli enim servi crucis inveniunt vitam beatitudinis et veræ lucis.	“If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. If thou wilt know the truth, believe in Me. If thou wilt be perfect, sell all that thou hast. If thou wilt be My disciple, deny thyself. If thou wouldst possess the blessed life, despise the life which now is. If thou wilt be exalted in heaven, humble thyself in the world. If thou wilt reign with Me, bear the cross with Me; for only the servants of the cross find the way of blessedness and of true light.”
533	3	III.310	310	Domine Jesu Christe, quia arta erat vita tua, et mundo despecta; dona mihi tecum mundi despectum imitari.Non enim servus est major domino suo, nec discipuus supra magistrum.Exerceatur servus tuus in vita tua, quia ibi est salus mea et sanctitas vera. Quidquid extra eam lego et audio, non me recreat nec delectat plene.	O Lord Jesu, forasmuch as Thy life was straitened and despised by the world, grant unto me to imitate Thee in despising the world, for the servant is not greater than his lord, nor the disciple above his master. Let Thy servant be exercised in Thy life, because there is my salvation and true holiness. Whatsoever I read or hear besides it, it refresheth me not, nor giveth me delight.
534	3	III.311	311	Fili, quia hæc scis et legisti omnia, beatus eris si feceris ea.Qui habet mandata mea et servat ea, ipse estquidiligit me, et ego diligam eum et manifestabo ei meipsumet faciam ipsum consedere mecum in regno Patris mei. Igitur, Domine, sicut dixisti et promisisti, sic utique mihi promereri contingat. Suscepi, suscepi de manu tua crucem: portabo eam usque ad mortem, sicut imposuisti mihi. Vere vita boni Monachi crux est, sed dux paradisi. Inceptum est, retro abire non licet, nec relinquere oportet.	“My son, because thou knowest these things and hast read them all, blessed shalt thou be if thou doest them. He who hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him, and I will make him to sit down with Me in My Father’s Kingdom.” O Lord Jesu, as Thou hast said and promised, even so let it be unto me, and grant me to prove worthy. I have received the cross at Thy hand; I have carried it, and will carry it even unto death, as Thou hast laid it upon me. Truly the life of a truly devoted servant is a cross, but it leadeth to paradise. I have begun; I may not return back nor leave it.
535	3	III.312	312	Eja fratres, pergamus simul: Jesus erit nobiscum; propter Jesum suscepimus hanc crucem; propter Jesum perfeveremus in cruce; erit adjutor noster, qui est dux noster et præcessor. En rex noster ingrediatur ante nos, qui pugnabit pro nobis. Sequamur viriliter, nemo metuat terrores; simus parati mori fortiter in bello, nec inferamus crimen gloriæ nostræ, et fugiamus a cruce.	Come, my brothers, let us together go forward. Jesus shall be with us. For Jesus’ sake have we taken up this cross, for Jesus’ sake let us persevere in the cross. He will be our helper, who was our Captain and Forerunner. Behold our King entereth in before us, and He will fight for us. Let us follow bravely, let no man fear terrors; let us be prepared to die bravely in battle, and let us not so stain our honour, as to fly from the cross.
536	3	III.313	313	Quod homo non sit nimis dejectus, quando labitur in aliquos defectus.	LVII That a man must not be too much cast down when he falleth into some faults
537	3	III.314	314	Fili, magis placent patientia et humilitas in adversis, quam multa consolatio et devotio in prosperis. Ut quid te contristat parvum factum contra te dictum? Si amplius fuisset, commoveri non debuisses. Sed nunc dimitte transire: non est primum nec novum nec ultmum erit, si diu vixeris. Satis virilis es, quamdiu nil obviat adversi; bene etiam consulis et alios nosti roborare verbis: sed cum ad januam tuam venit repentina tribulatio, deficis consilio et robore.	“My Son, patience and humility in adversities are more pleasing to Me than much comfort and devotion in prosperity. Why doth a little thing spoken against thee make thee sad? If it had been more, thou still oughtest not to be moved. But now suffer it to go by; it is not the first, it is not new, and it will not be the last, if thou live long. Thou art brave enough, so long as no adversity meeteth thee. Thou givest good counsel also, and knowest how to strengthen others with thy words; but when tribulation suddenly knocketh at thine own door, thy counsel and strength fail. Consider thy great frailty, which thou dost so often experience in trifling matters nevertheless, for thy soul’s health these things are done when they and such like happen unto thee.
538	3	III.315	315	Attende magnam fragilitatem tuam, quam sæpius experiris in modicis objectis: tamen pro salute tua ista fiunt. Cum hæc et similia contingunt, pone te ut melius nosti ex corde; et si tetigerit tribulatio, non tamen dejiciat nec diue implicet. Ad minus sustine patienter, si non potes gaudenter. Et si minus libenter audis et indignationem sentis, reprime te, nec patiaris aliquid inordinatum ex ore tuo exire, unde parvuli scandalizentur. Cito conquiescet commotio excitata, et dolor internus revertente gratia dulcorabitur. Adhuc vivo ego, dixit Dominus; juvare te paratus sum et solito amplius consolari, si confisus fueris in me, et devote invocaveris me.	“Put them away from thy heart as well as thou canst, and if tribulation hath touched thee, yet let it not cast thee down nor entangle thee long. At the least, bear patiently, if thou canst not joyfully. And although thou be very unwilling to hear it, and feel indignation, yet check thyself, and suffer no unadvised word to come forth from thy lips, whereby the little ones may be offended. Soon the storm which hath been raised shall be stilled, and inward grief shall be sweetened by returning grace. I yet live, saith the Lord, ready to help thee, and to give thee more than wonted consolation if thou put thy trust in Me, and call devoutly upon Me.
539	3	III.316	316	Animæquior esto et ad majorem sustinentiam accingere. Non est totum frustratum, si te sæpius percipis tribulatum vel graviter tentatum. Homo es, et non Deus; caro es, et non Angelus. Quomodo tu posses semper in eodem statu virtutis permanere, quando hoc defuit Angelo in cælo, et primo Homini in paradiso, quid non diu steterunt? Ego sum qui mærentes erigo sospitate, et suam cognoscentes infirmitatem ad meam provoco divinitatem.	“Be thou more calm of spirit, and gird thyself for greater endurance. All is not frustrated, though thou find thyself very often afflicted or grievously tempted. Thou art man, not God; thou art flesh, not an angel. How shouldst thou be able to remain alway in the same state of virtue, when an angel in heaven fell, and the first man in paradise? I am He who lifteth up the mourners to deliverance, and those who know their own infirmity I raise up to my own nature.”
540	3	III.317	317	Domine, benedictum sit verbum tuum,dulce super mel et favumori meo. Quid facerem in tantis tribulationibus et angustiis meis, nisi me confortares tuis sanctis sermonibus? Dummodo tandem ad portum salutis perveniam, quid mihi curæ est, quæ et quanta passus fuero? Da finem bonum et da felicem ex hoc mundo transitum. Memento mei, Deus meus, et dirige me recto itinere in regnum tuum. Amen.	O Lord, blessed be Thy word, sweeter to my mouth than honey and the honeycomb. What should I do in my so great tribulations and anxieties, unless Thou didst comfort me with Thy holy words? If only I may attain unto the haven of salvation, what matter is it what things or how many I suffer? Give me a good end, give me a happy passage out of this world. Remember me, O my God, and lead me by the right way unto Thy Kingdom. Amen.
541	3	III.318	318	De altioribus rebus et occultis Dei judiciis non scrutandis.	LVIII Of deeper matters, and God’s hidden judgments which are not to be inquired into
542	3	III.319	319	Fili, caveas disputare de altis materiis et de occultis Dei judiciis: cur iste sic relinquitur, et ille ad tantam gratiam assumitur? cur etiam iste tantum affligitur, et ille tam eximie exaltatur? Ista omnem facultatem humanam excedunt, nec ad investigandum divum judicium ulla ratio prævalet vel disputatio. Quando ergo hæc tibi suggerit inimicus vel etiam quidam curiosi inquirunt homines, responde illud Prophetæ:Justus es, Domine, et justum judicium tuum; et illud:Judicia Domini vera justificata in semetipsa.Judicia mea metuenda sunt, non discutienda, quia humano intellectua sunt incomprehensibilia.	“My Son, beware thou dispute not of high matters and of the hidden judgments of God; why this man is thus left, and that man is taken into so great favour; why also this man is so greatly afflicted, and that so highly exalted. These things pass all man’s power of judging, neither may any reasoning or disputation have power to search out the divine judgments. When therefore the enemy suggesteth these things to thee, or when any curious people ask such questions, answer with that word of the Prophet, Just art Thou, O Lord, and true is Thy judgment , and with this, The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether . My judgments are to be feared, not to be disputed on, because they are incomprehensible to human understanding.
543	3	III.320	320	Noli etiam inquirere nec disputare de meritis Sanctorum, quis alio sit sanctior; aut quis major sit in regno cælorum. Talia generant sæpe lites et contentiones inutiles, nutriunt quoque superbiam et vanam gloriam: unde oriuntur invidiæ et dissensiones, dum ille istum Sanctum, et alius alium conatur superbe præfferre. Talia autem velle scire et investigare nullum fructum afferunt, sed magis Sanctis displicent, quianon sum Deus dissensionis, sed pacis, quæ pax magis in humilitate vera, quam in propria exaltatione consisit.	“And be not given to inquire or dispute about the merits of the Saints, which is holier than another, or which is the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven. Such questions often beget useless strifes and contentions: they also nourish pride and vain glory, whence envyings and dissensions arise, while one man arrogantly endeavoureth to exalt one Saint and another another. But to wish to know and search out such things bringeth no fruit, but it rather displeaseth the Saints; for I am not the God of confusion but of peace; which peace consisteth more in true humility than in self-exaltation.
544	3	III.321	321	Quidam zelo devotionis trahuntur ad hos Sanctos vel ad illos, ampliori effectu, sed humano potius, quam divino. Ego sum qui cunctos condidi Sanctos; ego donavi gratiam; ego præstiti gloriam. Ego novi singulorum merita;ego præveni eos in benedictionibus dulcedinismeæ. Ego præscivi dilectos meos ante sæcula;ego eos elegi de mundo,non ipsi me præelegerunt. Ego vocavi per gratiam, attraxi per miscericordiam; ego perduxi eos per tentationes varias. Ego infudi consolationes magnificas; ego dedi perseverantiam; ego coronavi eorum patientiam.	“Some are drawn by zeal of love to greater affection to these Saints or those; but this is human affection rather than divine. I am He Who made all the Saints: I gave them grace, I brought them glory; I know the merits of every one; I prevented them with the blessings of My goodness . I foreknew my beloved ones from everlasting, I chose them out of the world; they did not choose Me. I called them by My grace, drew them by My mercy, led them on through sundry temptations. I poured mighty consolations upon them, I gave them perseverance, I crowned their patience.
545	3	III.322	322	Ego primum et novissimum agnosco; ego omnes inæstimabili dilectione amplector. Ego laudandus sum in omnibus Sanctis meis; ego super omnia benedicendus sum et honorandus in singulis, quos sic gloriose magnificavi, et prædestinavi sine ullis præcedentibus propriis meritis. Qui ergo unum de minimis meis contemsit, nec magnum honorat:quia pusillum et magnum ego feci.Qui derogat alicui Sanctorum, derogat et mihi, et omnibus cæteris in regno cælorum. Omnes unum sunt per charitatis vinculum, idem sentiunt, idem volunt et omnes in unum se diligunt.	“I acknowledge the first and the last; I embrace all with inestimable love. I am to be praised in all My Saints; I am to be blessed above all things, and to be honoured in every one whom I have so gloriously exalted and predestined, without any preceding merits of their own. He therefore that shall despise one of the least of these My people, honoureth not the great; because I made both small and great. And he who speaketh against any of My Saints speaketh against Me, and against all others in the Kingdom of Heaven.” They are all one through the bond of charity; they think the same thing, will the same thing, and all are united in love one to another.
546	3	III.323	323	Adhuc autem, quod multo altius est, plus me quam se et sua merita diligunt. Nam supra se rapti et extra propriam dilectionem tracti, toti in amorem meum pergunt, in quo et fruitive quiescunt. Nihil est quod eos avertere possit aut deprimere: quippe qui æterna veritate pleni, igne ardescunt inexstinguibilis charitatis. Taceant igitur carnales et animales homines de Sanctorum statu differere: qui non norunt nisi privata gaudia diligere; demunt et addunt pro sua inclinatione, non prout placet æternæ Veritati.	“But yet (which is far better) they love Me above themselves and their own merits. For being caught up above themselves, and drawn beyond self-love, they go all straightforward to the love of Me, and they rest in Me in perfect enjoyment. There is nothing which can turn them away or press them down; for being full of Eternal Truth, they burn with the fire of inextinguishable charity. Therefore let all carnal and natural men hold their peace concerning the state of the Saints, for they know nothing save to love their own personal enjoyment. They take away and add according to their own inclination, not as it pleaseth the Eternal Truth.
547	3	III.324	324	In multis est ignorantia, eorum maxime qui parum illuminati raro aliquem perfecta dilectione spirituali diligere norunt. Multi adhuc naturali affectu, et humana amicitia ad hos vel ad illos trahuntur; et sicut in inferioribus se habent, ita et de cælestibus imaginantur. Sed est distantia incomparabilis inter ea quæ imperfecti non cognitant, et ea quæ illuminati viri per revelationem contemplantur, et speculantur superna.	“In many men this is ignorance, chiefly is it so in those who, being little enlightened, rarely learn to love any one with perfect spiritual love. They are still much drawn by natural affection and human friendship to these or to those: and as they reckon of themselves in lower matters, so also do they frame imaginations of things heavenly. But there is an immeasurable difference between those things which they imperfectly imagine, and these things which enlightened men behold through supernatural revelation.
548	3	III.325	325	Cave ergo, fili, de istis curiose tractare, quæ scientiam tuam excedunt; sed hoc magis satage et intende, ut vel minimus in regno Dei queas inveniri. Et si quispiam sciret, quis alio sanctior esset, vel major haberetur in regno cælorum, quid ei hæc notitia prodesset, nisi se ex hac cognitione coram me humliaret, et in majorem mei nominis laudem exsurgeret? Multo acceptius Deo facit qui de peccatorum suorum magnitudine, et virtutum suarum parvitate cogitat, et quam longe a Sanctorum perfectione distat, quam is, qui de majoritate eorum vel parvitate disputat. Melius est Sanctos devotis precibus et lacrymis exorare et eorum gloriosa suffragia humili mente implicare, quam eorum secreta vana inquisitione perscrutari.	“Take heed, therefore, My son, that thou treat not curiously those things which surpass thy knowledge, but rather make this thy business and give attention to it, namely, that thou seek to be found, even though it be the least, in the Kingdom of God. And even if any one should know who were holier than others, or who were held greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven; what should that knowledge profit him, unless through this knowledge he should humble himself before Me, and should rise up to give greater praise unto My name? He who considereth how great are his own sins, how small his virtues, and how far he is removed from the perfection of the Saints, doeth far more acceptably in the sight of God, than he who disputeth about their greatness or littleness.
549	3	III.326	326	Illi bene et optime contentantur, si homines scirent contentari et vaniloquia sua compescere. Non gloriantur de propriis meritis, quippe qui sibi nil bonitatis adscribunt; sed totum mihi, quoniam ipsis cuncta ex infinita mea charitate donavi. Tanto amore divinitatis et gaudio supereffluenti replentur, ut nil desit eis gloriæ, nihilque desit felicitatis. Omnes Sancti quanto altiores in gloria tanto humiliores in se ipsis, et mihi viciniores et dilectiores existunt. Ideoque habes scriptum, quiamittebant coronas suas ante Deum, et ceciderunt in facies suas coram Agno et adoraverunt viventem in sæcula sæculorum.	“They are altogether well content, if men would learn to be content, and to refrain from vain babbling. They glory not of their own merits, seeing they ascribe no good unto themselves, but all unto Me, seeing that I of my infinite charity have given them all things. They are filled with so great love of the Divinity, and with such overflowing joy, that no glory is lacking to them, neither can any felicity be lacking. All the Saints, the higher they are exalted in glory, the humbler are they in themselves, and the nearer and dearer are they unto Me. And so thou hast it written that they cast their crowns before God and fell on their faces before the Lamb, and worshipped Him that liveth for ever and ever.
550	3	III.327	327	Multi quærunt, quis major sit in regno Dei, qui ignorant an cum minimis erunt digni computari. Magnum est vel esse minimum in cælo, ubi omnes magni sunt: quia omnes filii Dei vocabuntur et erunt.Minimus erit in mille et peccator centum annorum morietur.Cum enim quærerent Discipuli, quis major esset in regno cælorum, tale audierunt responsum:Nisi conversi fueritis et efficiamini sicut parvuli, non intrabitis in regnum cælorum. Quicumque ergo humiliaverit se sicut parvulus iste: hic major est in regno cælorum.	“Many ask who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, who know not whether they shall be worthy to be counted among the least. It is a great thing to be even the least in Heaven, where all are great, because all shall be called, and shall be, the sons of God. A little one shall become a thousand, but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed . For when the disciples asked who should be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven , they received no other answer than this, Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. But whosoever shall humble himself as this little child, the same shall be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven .”
551	3	III.328	328	Væ eis, qui cum parvulis se humiliare sponte dedignantur, quoniam humilis janua regni cælestis eos non admittet intrare.Væetdivitibus, qui habent consolationes suashic, quia pauperibus intrantibus in regnum Dei, ipsi stabunt foris ejulantes. Gaudete humiles, et exultate pauperes, quia vestrum est regnum Dei, si tamen in veritate ambulatis.	Woe unto them who disdain to humble themselves willingly with the little children; for the low gate of the kingdom of Heaven will not suffer them to enter in. Woe also to them who are rich, who have their consolation here; because whilst the poor enter into the kingdom of God, they shall stand lamenting without. Rejoice ye humble, and exult ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God if only ye walk in the truth.
552	3	III.329	329	Quod omnis spes et fiducia in solo Deo et figenda.	LIX That all hope and trust is to be fixed in God alone
553	3	III.330	330	Domine, quæ est fiducia mea quam in hac vita habeo, aut quod majus solatium meum ex omnibus apparentibus sub cælo? Nonne tu, Domine Deus meus, cujus misericordiæ non est numerus? Ubi mihi bene fuit sine te? Aut quando male esse potuit præsente te? Malo pauper esse propter te, quam dives sine te. Eligo potius tecum in terra peregrainari, quam sine te cælum possidere. Ubi tu, ibi cælum; atque ibi mors est atque infernus, ubi tu non es. Tu mihi in desiderio es, et ideo post te gemere et clamare et exorare necesse est. In nullo denique possum plene considere, qui in necessitatibus auxilietur opportunius, nisi in te solo Deo meo. Tu es spes mea, et fiducia mea, et consolator meus, et fidelissimus in omnibus.	O Lord, what is my trust which I have in this life, or what is my greatest comfort of all the things which are seen under Heaven? Is it not Thou, O Lord my God, whose mercies are without number? Where hath it been well with me without Thee? Or when could it be evil whilst Thou wert near? I had rather be poor for Thy sake, than rich without Thee. I choose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with Thee than without Thee to possess heaven. Where Thou art, there is heaven; and where Thou are not, behold there death and hell. Thou art all my desire, and therefore must I groan and cry and earnestly pray after Thee. In short I can confide fully in none to give me ready help in necessities, save in Thee alone, O my God. Thou art my hope, Thou art my trust, Thou art my Comforter, and most faithful in all things.
554	3	III.331	331	Omnes quæ sua sunt quærunt; tu salutem meam, et profectum meum solummodo prætendis et omnia in bonum mihi convertis. Et si variis tentationibus et adversitatibus exponas me, hoc totum ad utilitatem meam ordinas, qui mille modis dilectos tuos probare consuevisti. In qua probatione non minus diligi debes et laudari, quam si cælestibus consolationibus me repleres.	All men seek their own; Thou settest forward only my salvation and my profit, and turnest all things unto my good. Even though Thou dost expose me to divers temptations and adversities, Thou ordainest all this unto my advantage, for Thou are wont to prove Thy beloved ones in a thousand ways. In which proving Thou oughtest no less to be loved and praised, than if Thou wert filling me full of heavenly consolations.
555	3	III.332	332	In te ergo, Domine Deus meus, pono totam spem meam et refugium; in te omnem tribulationem meam et angustiam meam constituo, quia totum infirumum et instabile invenio quidquid extra te conspicio. Non enim proderunt multi amici, neque fortes auxiliarii adjuvare poterunt, neque prudentes consiliarii responsum utile dare, neque libri Doctorum consolari, nec alia prætiosa substantia liberare, neque locus aliquis secretus contutari, si tu ipse non assistas, juves, confortes, consoleris, instruas et custodias.	In Thee, therefore, O Lord God, I put all my hope and my refuge, on Thee I lay all my tribulation and anguish; because I find all to be weak and unstable whatsoever I behold out of Thee. For many friends shall not profit, nor strong helpers be able to succour, nor prudent counsellors to give a useful answer, nor the books of the learned to console, nor any precious substance to deliver, nor any secret and beautiful place to give shelter, if Thou Thyself do not assist, help, strengthen, comfort, instruct, keep in safety.
556	3	III.333	333	Omnia namque, quæ ad pacem videntur esse et felicitatem habendam, te absente nihil sunt, nihilque felicitatis et veritate conferunt. Finis ergo omnium bonorum et altitudo vitæ et profunditas eloquiorum tu es; et in te super omnia sperare, fortissimum solatium omnium servorum tuorum. Ad te sunt oculi mei; in te confido, Deus meus; misericordiarum Pater, benedic et sanctifica animam meam benedictione cælesti, ut fiat habitatio sancta tua et sedes æternæ gloriæ tuæ, nihilque in templo tuæ dignitatis inveniatur, quod oculos tuæ majestatis offendat.Secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarumet magnitudinem bonitatis tuærespice in me,et exaudi orationem pauperis servi tui, longe exulantis in regione umbræ mortis. Protege et conserva animam servuli tui inter tot discrimina vitæ corruptibilis, ac comitante gratia tua, dirige per viam pacis ad perpetuæ patriam felicitatis et claritatis.	For all things which seem to belong to the attainment of peace and felicity are nothing when Thou art absent, and bring no felicity at all in reality. Therefore art Thou the end of all good, and the fulness of Life, and the soul of eloquence; and to hope in Thee above all things is the strongest solace of Thy servants. Mine eyes look unto Thee , in Thee is my trust, O my God, Father of mercies. Bless and sanctify my soul with heavenly blessing that it may become Thy holy habitation, and the seat of Thy eternal glory; and let nothing be found in the Temple of Thy divinity which may offend the eyes of Thy majesty. According to the greatness of Thy goodness and the multitude of Thy mercies look upon me, and hear the prayer of Thy poor servant, far exiled from Thee in the land of the shadow of death. Protect and preserve the soul of Thy least servant amid so many dangers of corruptible life, and by Thy grace accompanying me, direct it by the way of peace unto its home of perpetual light.

Verba quæ ego locutus sum nobis, spiritus et vita sunt.	Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you, saith the Lord. The bread that I will give is My flesh which I give for the life of the world. Take, eat: this is My Body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of Me. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood dwelleth in Me and I in him. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

Quia ergo tua grantater mihi et fideliter sunt accipienda, tua sunt, et tu ea protulisti, et mea quoque sunt, quia pro salute mea edidisti: libenter suspicio ea ex ore tuo, ut aptius inferantur cordi meo. Excitant me verba tantæ pietatis, plena dulcendinis et dilectionis: sed terrent me delicta propria, et ad capienda tanta mysteria me reverberat impura conscientia. Provocat me dulcedo verborum tuorum, sed onerat me multitudo vitiorum meorum.	These are Thy words, O Christ, Eternal Truth; though not uttered at one time nor written together in one place of Scripture. Because therefore they are Thy words and true, I must gratefully and faithfully receive them all. They are Thine, and Thou hast uttered them; and they are mine also, because Thou didst speak them for my salvation. Gladly I receive them from Thy mouth, that they may be more deeply implanted in my heart. Words of such great grace arouse me, for they are full of sweetness and love; but my own sins terrify me, and my impure conscience driveth me away from receiving so great mysteries. The sweetness of Thy words encourageth me, but the multitude of my faults presseth me down.

Sed quis ego sum, Dominus, ut ad te præsumam accedere?Ecce cæli cælorum te non capiunt,et tu dicis:Venite ad me omnes?	Thou commandest that I draw near to Thee with firm confidence, if I would have part with Thee, and that I receive the food of immortality, if I desire to obtain eternal life and glory. Come unto Me, sayest Thou, all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Oh, sweet and lovely word in the ear of the sinner, that Thou, O Lord my God, dost invite the poor and needy to the Communion of Thy most holy body and blood. But who am I, O Lord, that I should presume to approach unto Thee? Behold the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee, and yet Thou sayest, Come ye all unto Me.
564	4	IV.8	8	Quid vult ista piissima dignatio, et tam amicabilis invitatio? Quomodo ausus ero venire, qui nihil boni mihi conscius sum, unde possim præsumere?

Reverentur Angeli et Archangeli, metuunt Sancti et Justi, et tu dicis:Venite ad me omnes?Nam nisi tu, Domine, diceres, quis verum esse crederet? Et nisi tu juberes, quis accedere tentaret?	What meaneth this most gracious condescension, this most lovely invitation? How shall I dare to come, who know no good thing of myself, whence I might be able to presume? How shall I bring Thee within my house, seeing that I so often have sinned in Thy most loving sight? Angels and Archangels stand in awe of Thee, the Saints and just men fear Thee, and Thou sayest, Come unto Me! Except Thou, Lord, hadst said it, who should believe it true? And except Thou hadst commanded, who should attempt to draw near?
565	4	IV.9	9	Ecce vir justus Noe in arcæ fabrica centum annis laboravit, ut cum paucis salvaretur: et ego quomodo potero me una hora præparare, ut mundi fabricatorent cum reverentia sumam? Moyses, famulus tuus, magnus et specialis amicus tuus, arcam ex lignis imputribilibus fecit, quam et mundissimo vestivit auro, ut tabulas Legis in ea reponeret: et ego putrida creatura, audebo te Conditorem legis, ac vitæ datorem tuam facile suscipere? Salomon, sapientissimus regum Israel, magnificum templukm septem annis in laudem nominis tui ædificavit, et octo diebus festum dedicationis ejus celebravit, mille hostias pacificas obtulit, et arcam fæderis, clangore buccinæ et jubilo in loco sibi præparato solemniter collocavit. Et ego infelix et pauperrimus hominum, quomodo te in domum meam introducam, qui vix mediam expendere devote novi horam, et utinam vel fere semel mediam digne.	Behold, Noah, that just man, laboured for a hundred years in building the ark, that he might be saved with the few; and I, how shall I be able in one hour to prepare myself to receive the Builder of the world with reverence? Moses, Thy servant, Thy great and especial friend, made an ark of incorruptible wood, which also he covered with purest gold, that he might lay up in it the tables of the law, and I, a corruptible creature, shall I dare thus easily to receive Thee, the Maker of the Law and the Giver of life? Solomon, the wisest of the kings of Israel, was seven years building his magnificent temple to the praise of Thy Name, and for eight days celebrated the feast of its dedication, offered a thousand peace offerings, and solemnly brought up the Ark of the Covenant to the place prepared for it, with the sound of trumpets and great joy, and I, unhappy and poorest of mankind, how shall I bring Thee into my house, who scarce know how to spend half an hour in devotion? And oh that it were even one half hour worthily spent!
566	4	IV.10	10	O, mi Deus, quantum illi ad placendum tibi agere studuerunt. Heu quam pusillum est quod ago, quam breve expleo tempus, cum me ad communicandum dispono. Raro totus collectus, rarissime abo omni distractione purgatus.	O my God, how earnestly these holy men strove to please Thee! And alas! how little and trifling is that which I do! how short a time do I spend, when I am disposing myself to Communion. Rarely altogether collected, most rarely cleansed from all distraction. And surely in the saving presence of Thy Godhead no unmeet thought ought to intrude, nor should any creature take possession of me, because it is not an Angel but the Lord of the Angels, that I am about to receive as my Guest.
567	4	IV.11	11	Et certe in tua salutari Deitatis præsentia nulla deberet occurrere indecens cogitatio; nulla etiam occupare creatura, quia non ad Angelum, sed Angelorum Dominum suscepturus sum hospitio. Est tamen magna distantia inter arcam fœderis Domini cum suis reliquiis, et mundissimum Corpus tuum cum suis ineffabilibus virtutibus; inter legalia illa sacrificia futurorum præfigurativa, et veram tui Corporis hostiam, omnium antiquorum sacrificiorum completivam.	Yet there is a vast difference between the Ark of the Covenant with its relics, and Thy most pure Body with its ineffable virtues, between those sacrifices of the law, which were figures of things to come, and the true sacrifice of Thy Body, the completion of all the ancient sacrifices.
568	4	IV.12	12	Quare igitur ad tuam non magis inardesco venerabilem præsentiam? Cur majori me non præparo sollicitudine ad tua Sancta sumenda, quandoilli antiqui sancti Patriarchæ, Reges quoque et Principes cum universo populo tantum devotionis monstrarunt affectum erga cultum divinum?	Wherefore then do I not yearn more ardently after Thy adorable presence? Why do I not prepare myself with greater solicitude to receive Thy holy things, when those holy Patriarchs and Prophets of old, kings also and princes, with the whole people, manifested so great affection of devotion towards Thy Divine Service?
569	4	IV.13	13	Saltavit rex devotissimus David coram arca Dei totis veribus, recolens beneficia olim indulta Patribus. Fecit diversi generis organa, psalmos edidit, et cantari institui cum lætitia, cecinit et ipse frequenter in cithara, Spiritus sancti afflatus gratia, docuit populum Israel toto corde laudare Deum, et ore consono diebus singulis benedicere et prædicare. Si tanta agebatur tunc devotio, ac divinæ laudis extitit recordatio coram arca testamenti, quanta nunc mihi et omni populo Christiano habenda est devotio et reverentia in præsentia Sacramenti, in sumtione excellentissimi corporis Christi?	The most devout king David danced with all his might before the Ark of God, calling to mind the benefits granted to his forefathers in days past; he fashioned musical instruments of various sorts, put forth Psalms, and appointed them to be sung with joy, played also himself ofttimes on the harp, being inspired with the grace of the Holy Ghost; he taught the people of Israel to praise God with the whole heart, and with unity of voice to bless and praise Him every day. If so great devotion was then exercised, and celebration of divine praise was carried on before the Ark of the Testimony, how great reverence and devotion ought now to be shown by me and all Christian people at the ministering of the Sacrament, at receiving the most precious Body and Blood of Christ.
570	4	IV.14	14	Currunt multi ad diversa loca pro visitandis reliquiis Sanctorum, et mirantur auditis gestis eorum; ampla ædificia templorum inspiciunt, et osculantur sericis et auro involuta sacra ossa eorum. Et ecce tu præsens es hic apud me in altari, Deus meus, Sanctus Sanctorum, hominum Creator et Dominus Angelorum. Sæpe in talibus videndis est curiositas hominum, est novitas invisorum et modicus reportabitur fructus emendationis, maxime ubi est tam levis, since vera contritione discursus. Hic autem in Sacramento altaris totus præsens es Deus meus, homo Christus Jesus: ubi et copiosus percipitur æternæ salutis fructus, quotescumque fueris digne ac devote susceptus. Ad istud vero non trahit levitas aliqua, nec curiositas vel sensualitas, sed firma fides, devota spes, et sincera charitas.	Many run to diverse places to visit the memorials of departed Saints, and rejoice to hear of their deeds and to look upon the beautiful buildings of their shrines. And behold, Thou art present here with me, O my God, Saint of Saints, Creator of men and Lord of the Angels. Often in looking at those memorials men are moved by curiosity and novelty, and very little fruit of amendment is borne away, especially when there is so much careless trifling and so little true contrition. But here in the Sacrament of the Altar, Thou art present altogether, My God, the Man Christ Jesus; where also abundant fruit of eternal life is given to every one soever that receiveth Thee worthily and devoutly. But to this no levity draweth, no curiosity, nor sensuality, only steadfast faith, devout hope, and sincere charity.
571	4	IV.15	15	O, invisibilis conditor mundi Deus, quam mirabiliter agis nobiscum, quam suaviter et gratiose cum electis tuis disponis, quibus temetipsum in Sacramento sumendum proponis. Hoc namque omnem intellectum superat; hoc specialiter devotorum corda trahit, et accendit affectum. Ipsi enim vere fideles tui, qui totam vitam suam ad emendationem disponunt, ex hoc Sacramento dignissimo magnam devotionis gratiam, et virtutis amorem frequenter recipiunt.	O God, invisible Creator of the world, how wondrously dost Thou work with us, how sweetly and graciously Thou dealest with Thine elect, to whom Thou offerest Thyself to be received in this Sacrament! For this surpasseth all understanding, this specially draweth the hearts of the devout and enkindleth their affections. For even thy true faithful ones themselves, who order their whole life to amendment, oftentimes gain from this most excellent Sacrament great grace of devotion and love of virtue.
572	4	IV.16	16	O, admirabilis et abscondita gratia Sacramenti, quam norunt tantum Christi fideles, infideles autem et peccatis servientes experiri non possunt. In hoc Sacramento confertur spiritualis gratia et reparatur in anima virtus amissa et per peccatum deformata redit pulchritudo. Tanta est aliquando hæc gratia, ut ex plenitudine collatæ devotionis non tantum mens, sed et debile corpus vires sibi præstitas sentiat ampliores.	Oh admirable and hidden grace of the Sacrament, which only Christ’s faithful ones know, but the faithless and those who serve sin cannot experience! In this Sacrament is conferred spiritual grace, and lost virtue is regained in the soul, and the beauty which was disfigured by sin returneth again. So great sometimes is this grace that out of the fulness of devotion given, not only the mind but also the weak body feeleth that more strength is supplied unto it.
573	4	IV.17	17	Dolendum tamen est, et miserandum valde super tepiditate, et negligentia nostra, quod non majori affectu trahimur ad Christum sumendum, in quo tota spes salvandorum consistit et meritum. Ipse enim est sanctificatio nostra et redemtio; ipse consolatio viatorum et Sancrotum æterna fruitio. Dolendum itaque valde, quod multi tam parum hoc salutare mysterium advertunt, quod cælum lætificat et mundum conservat universum. Heu cæcitas et duritia cordis humani, tam ineffabile donum non magis attendere, et ex quotidiano usu etiam inadvertentia defluere.	But greatly must we mourn and lament over our lukewarmness and negligence, that we are not drawn by greater affection to become partakers of Christ, in whom all the hope and the merit of those that are to be saved consist. For He Himself is our sanctification and redemption. He is the consolation of pilgrims and the eternal fruition of the Saints. Therefore it is grievously to be lamented that many so little consider this health-giving mystery, which maketh heaven glad and preserveth the whole world. Alas for the blindness and hardness of man’s heart, that he considereth not more this unspeakable gift, and even slippeth down through the daily use, into carelessness.
574	4	IV.18	18	Si enim hoc sanctissimum Sacramentum in uno tantum celebraretur loco, et ab uno tantum consecraretur Sacerdote in mundo, quanto putas desiderio ad illum locum, et talem Dei sacerdotem homines efficerentur, ut divinia ministeria celebrari audirent? Nunc autem multi facti sunt Sacerdotes et in multis locis offertur Christus: ut tanto major appareat gratia et dilectio Dei ad hominem, quanto latius est sacra Communio diffusa per omnem orbem.	For if this most holy Sacrament were celebrated in one place only, and were consecrated only by one priest in the whole world, with what great desire thinkest thou, would men be affected towards that place and towards such a priest of God, that they might behold the divine mysteries celebrated? But now are many men made priests and in many places the Sacrament is celebrated, that the grace and love of God towards men might the more appear, the more widely the Holy Communion is spread abroad over all the world.
575	4	IV.19	19	Gratias tibi, bone Jesu, pastor æterne, qui nos pauperes et exules dignatus est prætioso corpore et sanguine tuo reficere: et ad hæc mysteria percipienda etiam proprii oris tui eloquio invitare dicendo: Venite ad me omnes qui laboratis et onerati esti, et ego reficiam vos.	Thanks be unto Thee, O good Jesus, Eternal Shepherd, who hast vouchsafed to refresh us, poor and exiled ones, with Thy precious Body and Blood, and to invite us to partake these holy mysteries by the invitation from Thine own mouth, saying, Come unto Me, ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.
576	4	IV.20	20	II. Quod magna charitas et bonitas Dei in Sacramento exhibetur homini.	II That the greatness and charity of God is shown to men in the Sacrament The Voice of the Disciple
577	4	IV.21	21	Super bonitate tua et magna misericordia tua, Domine, confisus, accedo æger ad salvatorem, esuriens ad fontem vitæ, egenus ad Regem cæli, et sitiens servus ad Dominum, creatura ad Creatorem, disolatus ad meum pium Consolatorem. Sed unde mihi hoc ut venias ad me? Quis ego sum ut præstes mihi temetipsum? Quomodo audet peccator coram te apparere? Et quomodo tu dignaris ad peccatorem venire? Tu nosti servum tuum, et scis quia nihil coni in se est unde hoc illi præstes. Confiteor igitur vilitatem meam, agnosco tuam bonitatem, laudo pietatem, et gratias ago propter nimiam charitatem. Propter temetipsum hoc facis, non propter mea merita, ut bonitas tua mihi magis innotescat, charitas amplior ingeratur, et humilitas perfectius commendetur. Quia ergo tibi hoc placet et sic, fieri jussisti, placet et mihi dignatio tua, et utinam iniquitas mea non obsistat.	Trusting in Thy goodness and great mercy, O Lord, I draw near, the sick to the Healer, the hungering and thirsting to the Fountain of life, the poverty-stricken to the King of heaven, the servant to the Lord, the creature to the Creator, the desolate to my own gentle Comforter. But whence is this unto me, that Thou comest unto me? Who am I that Thou shouldest offer me Thyself? How doth a sinner dare to appear before Thee? And how dost thou vouchsafe to come to the sinner? Thou knowest Thy servant, and Thou knowest that he hath in him no good thing for which Thou shouldest grant him this grace. I confess therefore mine own vileness, I acknowledge Thy goodness, I praise Thy tenderness, and I give Thee thanks for Thine exceeding great love. For Thou doest this for Thine own sake, not for my merits, that Thy goodness may be more manifest unto me, Thy charity more abundantly poured out upon me, and Thy humility more perfectly commended unto me. Therefore because this pleaseth Thee and Thou hast commanded that thus it shall be, Thy condescension pleaseth me also; and oh that mine iniquity hinder it not.
578	4	IV.22	22	O, dulcissime, et benignissime Jesu, quanta tibi reverentia et gratiarum actio cum perpetua laude pro susceptione sacri Corporis tui debetur: cujus dignitatem nullus hominum explicare potens invenitur. Sed quid cogitabo in hac Communione, in accessu ad Dominum meum, quem debite venerari nequeo et tamen devote suscipere desidero? Quid cogitabo melius et salubrius nisi me ipsum totaliter humiliando coram te et tuam infinitam bonitatem exaltando supra me? Laudo te, Deus meus, et in æternum exalto te. Despicio me et subicio tibi in profundum vilitatis meæ.	O most sweet and tender Jesus, what reverence, what giving of thanks is due to Thee with perpetual praise for the receiving of Thy sacred Body and Blood, the dignity whereof no man is found able to express. But what shall I think upon in this Communion in approaching my Lord, whom I am not able worthily to honour, and nevertheless whom I long devoutly to receive? What shall be better and more healthful meditation for me, than utter humiliation of myself before Thee, and exaltation of Thine infinite goodness towards me? I praise Thee, O my God, and exalt Thee for evermore. I despise myself, and cast myself down before Thee into the deep of my vileness.
579	4	IV.23	23	Ecce tu Sanctus Sanctorum, et ego sordes peccatorum: et inclinas te ad me, qui non sum dignus ad te respicere. Ecce tu venis ad me, tu vis esse mecum; tu invitas ad vonvivium tuum, tu mihi daer vis cælestem cibum etpanem Angelorumad manducandum, non alium sane quam teipsum,panem vivum, qui de cælo descendistiet das vitam mundo.	Behold, Thou art the Saint of saints and I the refuse of sinners; behold, Thou stoopest unto me who am not worthy to look upon Thee; behold, Thou comest unto me, Thou willest to be with me, Thou invitest me to Thy feast. Thou willest to give me the heavenly food and bread of angels to eat; none other, in truth, than Thyself, The living bread, which didst descend from heaven; and givest life to the world.
580	4	IV.24	24	Ecce unde dilectio procedit, qualis dignatio illucescit; quam magnæ gratiarum actiones et laudes pro his tibi debentur. O, quam salutare et utile consilium tuum, cum istud constituisti. Quam sauve et jucundum convivium, cum teipsum in cibum donasti. O, quam admirabilis operatio tua, Domine; quam potens virtus tua, quam infallibilis veritas tua. Dixisti enim et facta sunt omnia, et hoc factum es quod jussisti: mira res et fide digna ac humanum vincens intellectum, quod tu, Domine Deus meus, verus Deus et homo, sub modica panis specie et vini integer contineris et sine consumtione a sumente manducaris.	Behold, whence this love proceedeth! what manner of condescension shineth forth herein. What great giving of thanks and praise is due unto Thee for these benefits! Oh how salutary and profitable Thy purpose when Thou didst ordain this! How sweet and pleasant the feast when Thou didst give Thyself for food! Oh how admirable is thy working, O Lord, how mighty Thy power, how unspeakable Thy truth! For Thou didst speak the word, and all things were made; and this is done which Thou hast commanded. A thing wonderful, and worthy of faith, and surpassing all the understanding of man, that Thou, O Lord my God, very God and very man, givest Thyself altogether to us in a little bread and wine, and art so our inexhaustible food.
581	4	IV.25	25	Tu, Domine universorum, qui nullius habens indigentiam voluisti per Sacramentum tuum habitare in nobis, conserva cor meum et corpus meum immaculatum, ut læta et pura conscientia sæpius valeam celebrare tua mysteria et ad meam perpetuam accipere salutem, quæ ad tuum præcipue honorem et memoriale perenne sanxisti et instituisti.	Thou, O Lord of all, who hast need of nothing, hast willed to dwell in us through Thy Sacrament. Preserve my heart and my body undefiled, that with a joyful and pure conscience I may be able very often to [celebrate, and] receive to my perpetual health. Thy mysteries, which Thou hast consecrated and instituted both for Thine own honour, and for a perpetual memorial.
582	4	IV.26	26	Lætare, anima mea, et gratias age Deo pro tam nobili munere et solatio singulari in hac lacrymarum valle tibi relicto. Nam quoties hoc mysterium recolis, et Christi corpus accipis, toties tuæ redemtionis opus agis et particeps omnium meritorum Christi efficeris: charitas etenim Christi nunquam minuitur, et magnitudo propitiationis ejus nunquam exhauritur. Ideo nova semper mentis renovatione ad hoc disponere te debes et magnum salutis mysterium attenta consideratione pensare. Ita magnum, novum et jucundum tibi videri debet, cum celebras aut missam audis, ac si eodem die Christus primum in uterum Virginis descendens homo factus esset, aut in cruce pendens pro salute hominum pateretur, et moreretur.	Rejoice, O my soul, and give thanks unto God for so great a gift and precious consolation, left unto thee in this vale of tears. For so oft as thou callest this mystery to mind and receivest the body of Christ, so often dost thou celebrate the work of thy redemption, and art made partaker of all the merits of Christ. For the charity of Christ never groweth less, and the greatness of His propitiation is never exhausted. Therefore, by continual renewal of thy spirit, thou oughtest to dispose thyself hereunto and to weigh the great mystery of salvation with attentive consideration. So great, new, and joyful ought it to appear to thee when thou comest to communion, as if on this self-same day Christ for the first time were descending into the Virgin’s womb and becoming man, or hanging on the cross, suffering and dying for the salvation of mankind.
583	4	IV.27	27	III. Quod utile est sæpe communicare.	III That it is profitable to Communicate often
584	4	IV.28	28	Ecce ego venio ad te, Domine, ut bene mihi sit exmunere tuo et lætificer in convivio tuo, quodparasti in dulcedine tua pauperi, Deus.Ecce in te test totum quod desiderare possum et debeo. Tu salus mea et redemtio, spes et fortitudo, decus et gloria.Lætificaergo hodieanimam famuli tui, quoniam ad te,Domine Jesu Christe,animam meam levavi.Desidero te nunc devote et reverenter suscipere, cupio te in domum meam introducere, quatenus cum Zachæo merear a te benedici ac inter filios Abrahæ computari. Anima mea et corpus meum te concupiscit, cor meum tecum uniri desiderat.	Behold I come unto Thee, O Lord, that I may be blessed through Thy gift, and be made joyful in Thy holy feast which Thou, O God, of Thy goodness hast prepared for the poor. Behold in Thee is all that I can and ought to desire, Thou art my salvation and redemption, my hope and strength, my honour and glory. Therefore rejoice the soul of Thy servant this day, for unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, do I lift up my soul. I long now to receive Thee devoutly and reverently, I desire to bring Thee into my house, so that with Zacchaeus I may be counted worthy to be blessed by Thee and numbered among the children of Abraham. My soul hath an earnest desire for Thy Body, my heart longeth to be united with Thee.
585	4	IV.29	29	Trade te mihi, et sufficit: name præter te nulla consolatio valet, sine te esse nequeo et sine visitatione tua vivere non valeo. Ideoque oportet me frequenter ad te accedere, et in remedium salutis meæ recipere, et in remedium salutis meæ recipere, ne forte deficiam in via, si fuero cælesti fraudatus alimonia. Sic enim tu, misericordissime Jesu, prædicans populis, et varios sanans languores, aliquando dixisti:Nolo eos dimittere jejunos in domum suam, ne dificiant in via.Age igitur hoc modo mecum, qui te pro fidelium consolatione in Sacramento reliquisti. Tu es enim refectio sauvis animæ, et qui te digne manducaverit, particeps et hæes erit æternæ gloriæ.	Give me Thyself and it sufficeth, for besides Thee no consolation availeth. Without Thee I cannot be, and without Thy visitation I have no power to live. And therefore I must needs draw nigh unto Thee often, and receive Thee for the healing of my soul, lest haply I faint by the way if I be deprived of heavenly food. For so Thou, most merciful Jesus, preaching to the people and healing many sick, didst once say, I will not send them away fasting to their own homes, lest they faint by the way. Deal therefore now to me in like manner, for Thou left Thyself for the consolation of the faithful in the Sacrament. For Thou art the sweet refreshment of the soul, and he who shall eat Thee worthily shall be partaker and inheritor of the eternal glory.
586	4	IV.30	30	Necessarium quidem mihi est, qui tam sæpe mihi labor et pecco, tam cito torpesco et deficio, ut per frequentes orationes et confessiones, ac sacram tui Corporis perceptionem me renovem, mundem et accendam, ne forte diutius abstinendo a sancto proposito defluam.Pronienimsunt sensus hominis ad malum ab adlescentia sua,et nisi succurrat divina medicina, labitur homo plus ad pejora. Retrahit ergo sancta Communio a malo, et confortat in bono. Si enim modo tam sæpe negligens sum et tepidus, quando communico aut celebro, quid fieret si medelam non sumerem et tam grande juvamen non quærerem? Et licet omni die non aptus, et ad celebrandum bene dispositus, dabo tamen operam congruis temporibus divina percipere mysteria, ac tantæ gratiæ participem me exhibere vel præbere. Nam hæc est una principalis fidelis animæ consolatio, quamdiu peregrinatur ad te in mortali corpore, ut sit sæpius memor Dei sui, dilectum suum devota suscipiat mente.	Necessary indeed it is for me, who so often slide backwards and sin, so quickly wax cold and faint, to renew, cleanse, enkindle myself by frequent prayers and penitences and receiving of Thy sacred Body and Blood lest haply by too long abstinence, I fall short of my holy resolutions. For the imaginations of man’s heart are evil from his youth, and except divine medicine succour him, man slideth away continually unto the worse. The Holy Communion therefore draweth us back from evil, and strengtheneth us for good. For if I now be so negligent and lukewarm when I communicate [or celebrate], how should it be with me, if I receive not this medicine, and sought not so great a help? [And though I am not every day fit nor well prepared to celebrate, I will nevertheless give diligent heed at due season, to receive the divine mysteries, and to become partaker of so great grace]. For this is the one principal consolation of a faithful soul, so long as it is absent from Thee in mortal body, that being continually mindful of its God, it receiveth its Beloved with devout spirit.
587	4	IV.31	31	O, mira circa nos tuæ pietatis dignatio: quod tu, Domine Deus, creator et vivificator omnium spirituum, ad pauperculam dignaris venire anima, et cum tota divinitate tua ac humanitate ejus impinguare esuriem. O, felix mens, et beata anima, quæ te, Dominum Deum suum, meretur devote suscipere, et in tua susceptone spirituali gaudio repleri. O, quam magnum suscipit Dominum, quam dilectum inducit hospitem, quam jucundum recipit socium quam fidelem acceptat amicum, quam speciosum, et nobilem amplectitur sponsum, præ omnibus dilectis, et super omnia desiderabilia amandum. Sileant a facie tua, dulcissime dilecte meus, cælum et terra, et omnibus ornatis eorum, quoniam quidquid habent laudis et decoris, ex dignatione tuæ est largitatis, nec ad decorem tui pervenient nominis, cujus sapientiæ non est numerus.	Oh wonderful condescension of Thy pity surrounding us, that Thou, O Lord God, Creator and Quickener of all spirits, deignest to come unto a soul so poor and weak, and to appease its hunger with Thy whole Deity and Humanity. Oh happy mind and blessed soul, to which is granted devoutly to receive Thee its Lord God, and in so receiving Thee to be filled with all spiritual joy! Oh how great a Lord doth it entertain, how beloved a Guest doth it bring in, how delightful a Companion doth it receive, how faithful a Friend doth it welcome, how beautiful and exalted a Spouse, above every other Beloved, doth it embrace, One to be loved above all things that can be desired! Oh my most sweet Beloved, let heaven and earth and all the glory of them, be silent in Thy presence; seeing whatsoever praise and beauty they have it is of Thy gracious bounty; and they shall never reach unto the loveliness of Thy Name, Whose Wisdom is infinite.
588	4	IV.32	32	Quod multa bona præstantur devote communicantibus.	IV That many good gifts are bestowed upon those who Communicate devoutly
589	4	IV.33	33	Domine Deus meus, præveni servum tuum in benedictione dulcedinis tuæ, ut ad tuum magnificum Sacramentum digne ac devote merear accedere. Excita cor meum in te, et a gravi torpore exue me. Visita me in salutari tuo ad gustandum in spiritu tuam sauvitatem, quæ in hoc Sacramento tanquam in fonte plenaire latet. Illumina quoque oculos meos ad intuendum tantum mysterium, et ad credendum illud indubitata fide me robora. Est enim operatio tua, non humana potentia: tua sacra institutio, non hominis adinventio. Non enim ad hæc capienda et intelligenda aliquis idoneus per se reperitur, quæ Angelicam etiam subtilitatem transcendunt. Quid ergo ego peccator indignus, terra et cinis, de tam alto secreto Sacramento potero investigare et capere?	O Lord my God, prevent Thou Thy servant with the blessings of Thy sweetness, that I may be enabled to draw near worthily and devoutly to Thy glorious Sacrament. Awaken my heart towards Thee, and deliver me from heavy slumber. Visit me with Thy salvation that I may in spirit taste Thy sweetness, which plentifully lieth hid in this Sacrament as in a fountain. Lighten also mine eyes to behold this so great mystery, and strengthen me that I may believe it with undoubting faith. For it is Thy word, not human power; it is Thy holy institution, not the invention of man. For no man is found fit in himself to receive and to understand these things, which transcend even the wisdom of the Angels. What portion then shall I, unworthy sinner, who am but dust and ashes, be able to search into and comprehend of so deep a Sacrament?
590	4	IV.34	34	Domine, in simplicitate cordis, in bona et firma fide et in tua visione ad te cum firm spe et reverentia accedo, et vere credo, quia tu præsens es hic in Sacramento Deus et homo. Vis ergo ut te suscipiam et me ipsum tibi in charitate uniam. Unde tuam precor clementiam, et specialem ad hoc imploro mihi donare gratiam, ut totus in te liquefiam, et amore pereffluam, atque de nulla alia consolatione amplius me intromittam. Est enim hoc altissimum et dignissimum Sacramentum, salus animæ et corporis, medicina omnis spiritualis languoris, in quo vitia mea curantur, passiones frænantur, tentationes vincuntur ac minuuntur, gratia major infunditur, virtus accepta augetur, firmatur fides, spes roboratur, et charitas ignescit ac dilatatur.	O Lord, in the simplicity of my heart, in good and firm faith, and according to Thy will, I draw nigh unto Thee with hope and reverence, and truly believe that Thou art here present in the Sacrament, God and man. Thou willest therefore that I receive Thee and unite myself to Thee in charity. Wherefore I beseech Thy mercy, and implore Thee to give me Thy special grace, to this end, that I may be wholly dissolved and overflow with love towards Thee, and no more suffer any other consolation to enter into me. For this most high and most glorious Sacrament is the health of the soul and the body, the medicine of all spiritual sickness, whereby I am healed of my sins, my passions are bridled, temptations are conquered or weakened, more grace is poured into me, virtue begun is increased, faith is made firm, hope is strengthened, and charity is enkindled and enlarged.
591	4	IV.35	35	Multa namque bona largitus es, et adhuc sæpius largiris in Sacramento dilectis tuis devote communicantibus, Deus meus susceptor animæ meæ, reparator infirmitatis meæ, et totius dator consolationis internæ. Nam multam ipsis consolationem adversus varias tribulatones infundis, et de imo dejectionis propriæ ad spem tuæ protectionis erigis atque nova quadam gratia eos intus recreas et illustra, ut qui anxii primo, et sine affectione se ante Communionem senserant, postea refecti cibo potuque cælesti, in melius se mutatos inveniant. Quod idcirco cum electis tuis ita dispensanter agis, ut veraciter agnoscant, et patenter experiantur, quam nihil ex semetipsis habeant, et quid bonitatis ac gratiæ ex te consequantur. Quia ex semetipsis frigidi duri ac indevoti, ex te autem serventes ac devoti et alacres esse merentur. Quis enim ad fontem suavitatis humiliter accedens, non modicum suavitatis inde reportat? Aut quis juxta ignem copiosum stans, non parum caloris inde percipit? Et tu fons es semper plenus et super abundans, ignis semper ardens et nunquam deficiens.	For in this Sacrament Thou hast bestowed many good things and still bestowest them continually on Thine elect who communicate devoutly, O my God, Lifter up of my soul, Repairer of human infirmity, and Giver of all inward consolation. For Thou pourest into them much consolation against all sorts of tribulation, and out of the deep of their own misery Thou liftest them up to the hope of Thy protection, and with ever new grace, dost inwardly refresh and enlighten them; so that they who felt themselves to be anxious and without affection before Communion, afterwards being refreshed with heavenly food and drink, find themselves changed for the better. And even in such wise Thou dealest severally with Thine elect, that they may truly acknowledge and clearly make proof that they have nothing whatsoever of their own, and what goodness and grace come to them from Thee; because being in themselves cold, hard of heart, indevout, through Thee they become fervent, zealous, and devout. For who is there coming humbly to the fountain of sweetness, carrieth not away thence at the least some little of that sweetness? Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a little of its heat? And Thou art ever a full and overflowing fountain, a fire continually burning, and never going out.
592	4	IV.36	36	Unde si mihi non licet haurire de plenitudine fontis, nec usque ad satietatem potare, apponam tamen os meum ad foramen cælestis fistulæ, ut saltem inde guttulam modicam capiam, ad refocillandam sitim meam, ut non penitus exarescam. Et si necdum totus cælesti, et tam ignitus, ut Seraphim et Cherubim esse possum, conabor tamen devotioni insistere et cor meum præparae, ut vel modicam divini incendii flammam ex humili sumtione vivifici Sacramenti conquiram. Quidquid autem mihi deest, bone Jesu, Salvator sanctissime, tu pro me supple benigne ac gratiose, qui omnes ad te gratiose vocare dignatus es, dicens:Venite ad me omnes qui laboratis et onerati esti, et ego reficiam vos.	Wherefore if it is not suffered to me to draw from the fulness of the fountain, nor to drink unto satisfying, yet will I set my lips to the mouth of the heavenly conduit, that at least I may receive a small drop to quench my thirst, that I dry not up within my heart. And if I am not yet able to be altogether heavenly and so enkindled as the Cherubim and Seraphim, yet will I endeavour to give myself unto devotion, and to prepare my heart, that I may gain if it be but a little flame of the divine fire, through the humble receiving of the life-giving Sacrament. But whatsoever is wanting unto me, O merciful Jesus, Most Holy Saviour, do Thou of Thy kindness and grace supply, who hast vouchsafed to call all unto Thee, saying, Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will refresh you.
593	4	IV.37	37	Ego quidem laboro in sudore vultus, mei, dolore cordis torqueor, peccatis oneror, tentationibus inquietor, multis malis passionibus implicor et premor, et non est qui adjuvet, non est qui liberet et salvum faciat, nisi tu, Domine Deus, Salvator meus, cui committo me et omnia mea, ut me custodias et perducas in vitam æternam. Suscipe me in laudem et gloriam nominis tui, qui Corpus tuum et Sanguinem in cibum et potum mihi parasti; præsta, Domine Deus Salutaris meus, ut cum frequentatione mysterii tui crescat meæ devotinis affectus.	I indeed labour in the sweat of my face, I am tormented with sorrow of heart, I am burdened with sins, I am disquieted with temptations, I am entangled and oppressed with many passions, and there is none to help me, there is none to deliver and ease me, but Thou, O Lord God, my Saviour, to whom I commit myself and all things that are mine, that Thou mayest preserve me and lead me unto life eternal. Receive me unto the praise and glory of Thy name, who hast prepared Thy Body and Blood to be my meat and drink. Grant, O Lord God my Saviour, that with coming often to Thy mysteries the zeal of my devotion may increase.
594	4	IV.38	38	De dignitate Sacramenti, et statu Sacerdotali.	V Of the dignity of this Sacrament, and of the office of the priest
595	4	IV.39	39	Si haberes angelicam puritatem, et sancti Johannis Baptistæ sanctitatem, non esses dignus hoc Sacramentum accipere nec tractare. Non hoc meritis debetur hominum, quod homo consecret et tractet Christi sacramentum et sumat in cibum panem Angelorum. Grande myterium et magna dignitas Sacerdotum, quibus datum est, quod Angelis non est concessum. Soli namque Sacerdotes in Ecclesia rite ordinati potestatem habent celebrandi et Corpus Christi consecrandi. Sacerdos quidem minister Dei est, utens verbo Dei per jussionem et institutionem Dei. Deus autem ibi est principalis auctor, et invisibilis operator, cui subest omne quod voluerit, et paret omne quod jusserit.	If thou hadst angelic purity and the holiness of holy John the Baptist, thou wouldest not be worthy to receive or to minister this Sacrament. For this is not deserved by merit of man that a man should consecrate and minister the Sacrament of Christ, and take for food the bread of Angels. Vast is the mystery, and great is the dignity of the priests, to whom is given what is not granted to Angels. For priests only, rightly ordained in the church, have the power of consecrating and celebrating the Body of Christ. The priest indeed is the minister of God, using the Word of God by God’s command and institution; nevertheless God is there the principal Author and invisible Worker, that to whom all that He willeth is subject, and all He commandeth is obedient.
596	4	IV.40	40	Plus ergo credere debes Deo omnipotenti in hoc excellentissimo Sacramento, quam proprio sensui aut alteri signo visibili. Ideoque cum timore et reverentia ad hoc opus est accedendum. Attende igitur et vide cujus ministerium tibi traditum est per impositionem manus Episcopi. Ecce Sacerdos factus es, et ad celebrandum consecratus: vide nunc ut fideliter et devote in suo tempore Deo sacrificum offeras, et teipsum irreprehensibilem exhibeas. Non alleviasti onus tuum, sed arctiori jam alligatus es vinculo disciplinæ, et ad majorem teneris perfectionem sanctitatis. Sacerdos debet esse omnibus virtutibus ornatus, et aliis bonæ vitæ exemplum præbere. Ejus conversatio non cum popularibus hominibus, sed cum Angelis in cælo, aut cum perfectis viris in terra.	Therefore thou must believe God Almighty in this most excellent Sacrament, more than thine own sense or any visible sign at all. And therefore with fear and reverence is this work to be approached. Take heed therefore and see what it is of which the ministry is committed to thee by the laying on of the Bishop’s hand. Behold thou art made a priest and art consecrated to celebrate. See now that thou do it before God faithfully and devoutly at due time, and shew thyself without blame. Thou hast not lightened thy burden, but art now bound with a straiter bond of discipline, and art pledged to a higher degree of holiness. A priest ought to be adorned with all virtues and to afford to others an example of good life. His conversation must not be with the popular and common ways of men, but with Angels in Heaven or with perfect men on earth.
597	4	IV.41	41	Sacerdos sacris vestibus indutus Christi vices gerit, ut Deum pro se et pro omni populo suo suppliciter et humiliter roget: habet ante se et post se Dominicæ Crucis signum ad memorandam jugiter Christi passionem. Ante se Crucem in casula portat, ut Christi vestigia diligenter inspiciat, et sequi frequenter studeat. Post se cruce signatus est, ut adversa quælibet illata ab aliis clementer pro Deo toleret. Ante se Crucem gerit, ut propria peccata lugeat;post se, ut aliorum etiam commissa per compassionem defleat, et se medium inter Deum et peccatorem constitutum esse sciat, nec ab oratione, nec ab oblatione sancta torpescat, donec gratiam et misericordiam impetrare mereatur. Quando Sacerdos celebrat, honorat Deum, Angelos lætificat, Ecclesiam ædificat, vivos adjuvat, defunctis requiem præstat, et sese omnium bonorum participem efficit.	A priest clad in holy garments taketh Christ’s place that he may pray unto God with all supplication and humility for himself and for the whole people. He must always remember the Passion of Christ. He must diligently look upon Christ’s footsteps and fervently endeavour himself to follow them. He must bear meekly for God whatsoever ills are brought upon him by others. He must mourn for his own sins, and for the sins committed by others, and may not grow careless of prayer and holy oblation, until he prevail to obtain grace and mercy. When the priest celebrateth, he honoureth God, giveth joy to the Angels, buildeth up the Church, helpeth the living, hath communion with the departed, and maketh himself a partaker of all good things.

599	4	IV.43	43	Cum tuam dignitatem, et meam vilitatem penso, valde contremisco, et in me ipso confundor. Si enim non accedo vitam fugio; et si indigne me ingesserio, offensam incurro. Quid ergo faciam, Deus auxiliator meus et consiliator meus in necessitatibus?	When I consider Thy dignity, O Lord, and mine own vileness, I tremble very exceedingly, and am confounded within myself. For if I approach not, I fly from life; and if I intrude myself unworthily, I run into Thy displeasure. What then shall I do, O my God, Thou helper and Counsellor in necessities.
600	4	IV.44	44	Tu doce me viam rectam, propone aliquod breve exercitium sacræ Communioni congruum. Utile est enim scire, qualiter scilicet devote et reverenter tibi præparare debeam cor meum ad recipiendum salubriter tuum Sacramentum, seu etiam celebrandum tam magnum et divinum sacrificium.	Teach Thou me the right way; propound unto me some short exercise befitting Holy Communion. For it is profitable to know how I ought to prepare my heart devoutly and reverently for Thee, to the intent that I may receive Thy Sacrament to my soul’s health [or it may be also for the celebrating this so great and divine mystery].
601	4	IV.45	45	De discussione propriæ conscientiæ et emendationis proposito.	VII Of the examination of conscience, and purpose of amendment
602	4	IV.46	46	Super omnia cum summa humilitate cordis et supplici reverentia, cum plena fide et pia intentione honoris Dei, ad hoc Sacramentum celebrandum, tractandum et sumendum oportet Dei accedere Sacerdotem. Diligenter examina conscientiam tuam, et pro posse tuo vera contritione, et humili confessione eam nuda e clarifica, ita ut nil grave habeas, aut scias, quod te remodeat et liberum accessum impediat. Habeas displicentiam omnium peccatorum tuorum in generali, et pro quotidianis excessibus magis in spirituali doleas et gemas; et, si tempus patiturum, Deo in secreto cordis cunctas confidere passionum tuarum miserias.	Above all things the priest of God must draw nigh, with all humility of heart and supplicating reverence, with full faith and pious desire for the honour of God, to celebrate, minister, and receive this Sacrament. Diligently examine thy conscience and with all thy might with true contrition and humble confession cleanse and purify it, so that thou mayest feel no burden, nor know anything which bringeth thee remorse and impedeth thy free approach. Have displeasure against all thy sins in general, and specially sorrow and mourn because of thy daily transgressions. And if thou have time, confess unto God in the secret of thine heart, all miseries of thine own passion.
603	4	IV.47	47	Ingemisce et dole, quod adhuc tam carnalis sis et mundanus, ita immortificatus a passionibus, tam plenus concupiscentiarum motibus, tam incustoditus in sensibus exterioribus, tam sæpe multis variis phantasiis implicatus, tam multum inclinatus ad exteriora, tam negligens ad interiora, tam levis ad risum et dissolutionem, tam durus ad fletum et compunctionem, tam promtus ad laxiora et carnis commoda, tam segnis ad rigorem et fervorem, tam curiosus ad nova capienda et audienda, et pulchra intuenda, tam remissus ad humilia et abjecta amplectenda, tam cupidus ad multa habenda, tam parcus ad dandum, tam tenax ad retinendum, tam inconsideratus in loquendo, tam incontinens ad tacendum, tam incompositus in moribus, tam importunus in actibus, tam effusus super cibum, tam surdus ad Dei verbum, tam velox ad quietem, tam tardus ad laborem, tam vigilans ad fabulas, tam somnolentus ad vigilias sacras; tam festinus ad finem, tam vagus ad attendendum, tam negligens in horis pervolvendis, tam tepidus in celebrando, tam aridus in communicando, tam cito distractus, tam raro tibi vene collectus, tam subito commotus ad iram, tam facilis ad alterius displicentiam, tam pronus ad judicandum, tam rigidus ad arguendum, tam lætus ad prospera, tam debilis in adversis, tam sæpe multa bona proponens, et modicum ad effectum perducens.	Lament grievously and be sorry, because thou art still so carnal and worldly, so unmortified from thy passions, so full of the motion of concupiscence, so unguarded in thine outward senses, so often entangled in many vain fancies, so much inclined to outward things, so negligent of internal; so ready to laughter and dissoluteness, so unready to weeping and contrition; so prone to ease and indulgence of the flesh, so dull to zeal and fervour; so curious to hear novelties and behold beauties, so loth to embrace things humble and despised; so desirous to have many things, so grudging in giving, so close in keeping; so inconsiderate in speaking, so reluctant to keep silence; so disorderly in manners, so inconsiderate in actions; so eager after food, so deaf towards the Word of God; so eager after rest, so slow to labour; so watchful after tales, so sleepy towards holy watchings; so eager for the end of them, so wandering in attention to them; so negligent in observing the hours of prayer, so lukewarm in celebrating, so unfruitful in communicating; so quickly distracted, so seldom quite collected with thyself; so quickly moved to anger, so ready for displeasure at others; so prone to judging, so severe at reproving; so joyful in prosperity, so weak in adversity; so often making many good resolutions and bringing them to so little effect.
604	4	IV.48	48	His et aliis defectibus tuis cum dolore et magna displicentia propriæ infirmitatis confessis ac deploratis firmum statue propositum semper emendandi vitam tuam, et in melius proficiendi. Deinde cum plena resignatione, et integra voluntate offer te ipsum in honore nominis mei in ara cordis tui holocastum peretuum, corpus tuum scilicet, et animam mihi fideliter commitendo, quatenus sic digne merearis ad offerendum Deo sacrificium accedere, et Sacramentum Corporis mei salubriter suscipere.	When thou hast confessed and bewailed these and thy other shortcomings, with sorrow and sore displeasure at thine own infirmity, make then a firm resolution of continual amendment of life and of progress in all that is good. Then moreover with full resignation and entire will offer thyself to the honour of My name on the altar of thine heart as a perpetual whole burnt-offering, even by faithfully presenting thy body and soul unto Me, to the end that thou mayest so be accounted worthy to draw near to offer this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to God, and to receive the Sacrament of My Body and Blood to thy soul’s health.
605	4	IV.49	49	Non est enim oblatio dignior, et satisfacio major pro peccatis diluendis quam se ipsum pure et integre cum oblatione Corporis Christi in missa et in communione Deo offerre. Si homo fecerit quod in se est, et vere pœnituerit, quotiescumque pro venia et gratia ad me accesserit:Vivo ego, dicit Dominusquinolo mortem peccatoris, sedmagisut convertatur et vivat,quoniampeccatorum suorum non recordabor amplius,sed cuncta sibi indulta erunt.	For there is no oblation worthier, no satisfaction greater for the destroying of sin, than that a man offer himself to God purely and entirely with the oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Holy Communion. If a man shall have done what in him lieth, and shall repent him truly, then how often soever he shall draw nigh unto Me for pardon and grace, As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted, and live. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him.
606	4	IV.50	50	De oblatione Christi in Cruce, et propria resignatione.	VIII Of the oblation of Christ upon the cross, and of resignation of self
607	4	IV.51	51	Sicut ego me ipsum expansis in cruce manibus et nudo corpore pro peccatis tuis Deo Patri sponte obtuli, ita ut nihil in me remaneret, quin totum in sacrificium divinæ placationis transierit: ita debes et tu temetipsum mihi voluntarie in oblationem uram et sanctam quotidie in Missa cum omnibus viribus et affectionibus tuis, quanto intimus vales, offere. Quid magis a te requiro, quam ut te studeas mihi in exintimo resignare? Quidquid præter teipsum das, nihil curo; quia non quæro datum tuum, sed te.	As I of my own will offered myself unto God the Father on the Cross for thy sins with outstretched hands and naked body, so that nothing remained in Me that did not become altogether a sacrifice for the Divine propitiation; so also oughtest thou every day to offer thyself willingly unto Me for a pure and holy oblation with all thy strength and affections, even to the utmost powers of thine heart. What more do I require of thee than thou study to resign thyself altogether unto Me? Whatsoever thou givest besides thyself, I nothing care for, for I ask not thy gift, but thee.
608	4	IV.52	52	Sicut non sufficeret tibi omnibus habitis præter me, ita nec mihi placere poterit quidquid dederis te non oblata. Offer te mihi, et da te totum pro Deo et erit accepta oblatio. Ecce ego me totum obtuli Patri pro te, dedi etiam totum corpus meum, et sanguinem in cibum, ut totus tuus essem, et tu meus permaneres. Si autem in teipso steteris, nec sponte te ad voluntatem meam obtuleris, non est plena oblatio, nec integra erit inter nos unio. Ideo omnia opera tua spontanea præcedere debet tui ipsius in manus Dei oblatio, si libertatem consequi vis et gratiam. Ideo tam pauci illuminati, et liberi intus efficiuntur, quia se ipso ex toto abnegare nesciunt. Est firma sententia mea:Nisi quis renunciaverit omnibus quæ possidet, non potest esse meus discipulus.Tu ergo si optas meus esse discipulus, offer teipsum mihi cum omnibus affectibus tuis.	As it would not be sufficient for thee if thou hadst all things except Me, even so whatsoever thou shalt give Me, if thou give Me not thyself, it cannot please Me. Offer thyself to Me, and give thyself altogether for God, so shall thy offering be accepted. Behold I offered Myself altogether to the Father for thee, I give also My whole body and blood for food, that thou mightest remain altogether Mine and I thine. But if thou stand in thyself, and offer not thyself freely to My will, thy offering is not perfect, neither shall the union betwixt us be complete. Therefore ought the freewill offering of thyself into the hands of God to go before all thy works, if thou wilt attain liberty and grace. For this is the cause that so few are inwardly enlightened and made free, that they know not how to deny themselves entirely. My word standeth sure, Except a man forsake all, he cannot be My disciple. Thou therefore, if thou wilt be My disciple, offer thyself to Me with all thy affections.
609	4	IV.53	53	Quod nos et omnia nostra Deo debemus offerre, et pro omnibus orare.	IX That we ought to offer ourselves and all that is ours to God, and to pray for all
610	4	IV.54	54	Domine, omnia tua sunt quæ in cælo sunt et in terra. Desidero me ipsum tibi in spontatneam oblationem offerre, et tuus perpetuo permanere. Domine, si in simplicitate cordis mei offero me ipsum tibi hodie in servum sempiternum, in obsequium et in sacrificium laudis perpetuæ. Suscipe me cum hac sancta oblatione tui prætiosi Corporis, quam hodie tibi in præsentia Angelorum invisibiliter assistentium offero, ut sit pro me et pro cuncto populo tuo in salutem.	Lord, all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine. I desire to offer myself up unto thee as a freewill offering, and to continue Thine for ever. Lord, in the uprightness of mine heart I willingly offer myself to Thee to-day to be Thy servant for ever, in humble submission and for a sacrifice of perpetual praise. Receive me with this holy Communion of Thy precious Body, which I celebrate before Thee this day in the presence of the Angels invisibly surrounding, that it may be for the salvation of me and of all Thy people.
611	4	IV.55	55	Domine, offero tibi omnia peccata mea et delicta mea, quæ commisi coram te et sanctis Angelis tuis, a die qua primum peccare potui usque ad diem hanc,super placabili altari tuo, ut te pariter omnia incendas, et comburas igne charitatis tuæ, et deleas universas maculas peccatorum meorum, et conscientiam meam ab omni delicto emundes, et restituas mihi gratiam tuam, quam peccando amisi, omnia mihi plene indulgendo et in osculum pacis me misericorditer assumendo.	Lord, I lay before Thee at this celebration all my sins and offences which I have committed before Thee and Thy holy Angels, from the day whereon I was first able to sin even unto this hour; that Thou mayest consume and burn them every one with the fire of Thy charity, and mayest do away all the stains of my sins, and cleanse my conscience from all offence, and restore me to Thy favour which by sinning I have lost, fully forgiving me all, and mercifully admitting me to the kiss of peace.
612	4	IV.56	56	Quid possum agere pro peccatis meis, nisi humiliter ea confitendo et lamentando et tuam propitiationem incessanter deprecando? Deprecor te, exaudi me propitius, ubi asto, coram te, Deus meus. Omnia peccata mea mihi maxime displicent; nolo ea nunquam amplius perpetrare, sed pro eis doleo, et dolebo, quamdiu vixero, paratus pœnitentiam agere, et pro posse satisfacere. Dimitte mihi, Deus, dimitte peccata mea, propter nomen sanctum tuum, salva animam meam, quam prætioso sanguine redemisti. Ecce committo me misericordiæ tuæ, resigno me in manibus tuis: age mecum secundum bontiatem tuam, non secundum meam malitiam et iniquitatem.	What can I do concerning my sins, save humbly to confess and lament them and unceasingly to beseech Thy propitiation? I beseech Thee, be propitious unto me and hear me, when I stand before Thee, O my God. All my sins displease me grievously: I will never more commit them; but I grieve for them and will grieve so long as I live, steadfastly purposing to repent me truly, and to make restitution as far as I can. Forgive, O God, forgive me my sins for Thy holy Name’s sake; save my soul, which Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious blood. Behold I commit myself to Thy mercy, I resign myself to Thy hands. Deal with me according to Thy loving-kindness, not according to my wickedness and iniquity.
613	4	IV.57	57	Offero etiam tibi omnia bona mea, quamvis pauca et imperfecta, ut tu ea emendes et sanctifices, ut ea grata habeas et accepta tibi facias et semper ad meliora trahas, nec non ad beatum et laudabilem finem: Domine, me pigrum et inutilem homuncionem perducas.	I offer also unto Thee all my goodness, though it is exceedingly little and imperfect, that Thou mayest mend and sanctify it, that Thou mayest make it well pleasing and acceptable in Thy sight, and ever draw it on towards perfection; and furthermore bring me safely, slothful and useless poor creature that I am, to a happy and blessed end.
614	4	IV.58	58	Offero quoque tibi omnia desideria devotorum, necessitates parentem, amicorum, fratrum, foroum, omniumque chariorum meorum et eorum qui mihi vel aliis propter amorem tuorum benefecerunt: qui orationes et Missas pro se, suique omnibus dici a me petierunt et desideraverunt, sive in carne adhuc vivant, sive jam sæculo defuncti sint, ut omnes sibi auxilium gratiæ tuæ, opem consolationis, protectionem a periculis, liberationem a pœnis advenire sentiant et ut ab omnibus malis erepti, gratias magnificas læti persolvant.	Moreover I offer unto Thee all pious desires of the devout, necessities of parents, friends, brothers, sisters, and all who are dear to me, and of those who have done good to me, or to others for Thy love; and those who have desired and besought my prayers for themselves and all belonging to them; that all may feel themselves assisted by Thy grace, enriched by consolation, protected from dangers, freed from pains; and that being delivered from all evils they may joyfully give Thee exceeding thanks.
615	4	IV.59	59	Offero etiam tibi preces placationis, pro illis specialiter qui me in aliquo læserunt, contristaverunt, aut vituperaverunt, vel aliquod damnum vel gravamen intulerunt, pro his quoque omnibus quos aliquando contristavi, conturbavi, gravavi, et scandalizavi, verbis vel factis, scienter et ignoranter, ut nobis omnibus pariter indulgeas omnia peccata nostra, et injurias et offensiones. Aufer, Domine, a cordibus nostris omnem suspicionem, indignationem, iram et discrepationem, et quidquid potest charitatem lædere et fraternam dilectionem minuere. Miserere, Domine, miserere misericordiam tuam poscentibus, da gratiam indigentibus, fac nos tales existere, ut simus digni gratia tua perfrui, et ad vitam proficiamus æternam.	I offer also to Thee prayers and Sacramental intercessions for those specially who have injured me in aught, made me sad, or spoken evil concerning me, or have caused me any loss or displeasure; for all those also whom I have at any time made sad, disturbed, burdened, and scandalized, by words or deeds, knowingly or ignorantly; that to all of us alike, Thou mayest equally pardon our sins and mutual offences. Take away, O Lord, from our hearts all suspicion, indignation, anger, and contention, and whatsoever is able to injure charity and diminish brotherly love. Have mercy, have mercy, Lord, on those who entreat Thy mercy; give grace to the needy; and make us such that we may be worthy to enjoy Thy grace, and go forward to the life eternal.
616	4	IV.60	60	Quod sacra Communio de facili non est reliquenda.	X That Holy Communion is not lightly to be omitted
617	4	IV.61	61	Frequenter recurrendum est ad fontem gratiæ et divinæ misericordiaæ, ad fontem bonitatis et totius puritatis, quatenus a passionibus tuis et vitiis curare valeas, et contra universas tentationes et fallacias diaboli fortior atque vigilantior effici merearis. Inimicus sciens fructum et remedium maximum in sacra Communione positum, omni modo et occasione nititur fideles et devotos quantum prævalet retrahere et impedire.	Thou must frequently betake thee to the Fountain of grace and divine mercy, to the Fountain of goodness and all purity; to the end that thou mayest obtain the healing of thy passions and vices, and mayest be made stronger and more watchful against all temptations and wiles of the devil. The enemy, knowing what profit and exceeding strong remedy lieth in the Holy Communion, striveth by all means and occasions to draw back and hinder the faithful and devout, so far as he can.
618	4	IV.62	62	Cum enim quidam sacræ Communioni disponunt, pejores Satanæ immissiones et illusiones patiuntur. Ipse namque Spiritus, ut in Job scribitur, venit inter filios Dei, ut solita ejus nequitia perturbet, aut timidos nimium reddat et perplexos, quatenus fructus eorum affectuum minuat vel fidem impugnando auferat, si forte aut omnino Communionem relinquant, aut cum tepore accedant. Sed non est quidquam curandum de versutiis et phantasiis illius quantumlibet turpibus et horrendis, sed cuncta phantasmata in caput ejus sunt retorquenda. Contemnendus est miser, et deridendus, nec propter insultus ejus et Commotiones, quas suscitat, sacra est omnittenda Communio.	For when some set about to prepare themselves for Holy Communion, they suffer from the more evil suggestions of Satan. The very evil spirit himself (as is written in Job), cometh among the sons of God that he may trouble them by his accustomed evil dealing, or make them over timid and perplexed; to the intent that he may diminish their affections, or take away their faith by his attacks, if haply he may prevail upon them to give up Holy Communion altogether, or to come thereto with lukewarm hearts. But his wiles and delusions must not be heeded, howsoever wicked and terrible they be; but all his delusion must be cast back upon his own head. The wretch must be despised and laughed to scorn: neither must Holy Communion be omitted because of his insults and the inward troubles which he stirreth up.
619	4	IV.63	63	Sæpe etiam impedit nimia sollicitudo pro devotione habenda et anxietas quædam de confessione facienda. Age secundum consilium sapientum; et depone anxietatem et scrupulum, quia gratiam Dei impedit et devotionem mentis destruit. Propter aliquam parvam tribulationem vel gravitatem sacram ne dimittas Communionem; sed vade citius conteri et omnes offensiones aliis libenter indulge. Si vero aliquem offendisti tu, tu veniam humiliter deprecare: et Deus libenter indulgebit tibi.	Often also too much carefulness or some anxiety or other touching confession hindereth from obtaining devotion. Do thou according to the counsel of wise men, and lay aside anxiety and scruple, because it hindereth the grace of God and destroyeth devotion of mind. Because of some little vexation or trouble do not thou neglect Holy Communion, but rather hasten to confess it, and forgive freely all offences committed against thee. And if thou hast offended any man, humbly beg for pardon, and God shall freely forgive thee.
620	4	IV.64	64	Quid prodest diu tardare confessionem, aut sacram differre Communinem? Expurga te quam primum; exspue velociter venenum, festina recipere remedium, et senties melius, quam si diu distuleris. Si hodie propter istud distuleris, cras fositan illud magis eveniet, et sic diu posses a Communione impediti et magis ineptus fieri. Quanto citius vales, a præsenti gravitate et inertia te excutias, quia nihil importat diu anxiari, diu cum tribulatione transire et ob quotidiana obstacula se a divinis sequestrare, immo plurimum nocet diu Communionem: protelare: nam et gravem torporem consuevit induceret. Proh dolor, quidam tepidi et dissoluti moras confitendi accipiunt libenter, et Communionem sacram idcirco differre cupiunt, ne ad majorem sui custodiam se dare teneantur.	What profiteth it to put off for long time the confession of thy sins, or to defer Holy Communion? Cleanse thyself forthwith, spit out the poison with all speed, hasten to take the remedy, and thou shalt feel thyself better than if thou didst long defer it. If to-day thou defer it on one account, to-morrow perchance some greater obstacle will come, and so thou mayest be long time hindered from Communion and become more unfit. As soon as thou canst, shake thyself from thy present heaviness and sloth, for it profiteth nothing to be long anxious, to go long on thy way with heaviness of heart, and because of daily little obstacles to sever thyself from divine things: nay it is exceeding hurtful to defer thy Communion long, for this commonly bringeth on great torpor. Alas! there are some, lukewarm and undisciplined, who willingly find excuses for delaying repentance, and desire to defer Holy Communion, lest they should be bound to keep stricter watch upon themselves.
621	4	IV.65	65	Heu, quam modicam charitatem, et debilem devotionem habent, qui sacram Communionem tam faciliter postponunt. Quam felix illle et Deo acceptus habetur, qui sic vivit, et tali puritate conscientiam suam custodit, ut etiam omni die communicare paratus et bene affectatus esset, si ei liceret, et sine nota agere posset. Si quis interdum abstinet humilitatis gratia, aut legitima impediente causa, laudandus est de reverentia. Si autem torpor obrepserit, seipsum excitare debet et facere quod in se est, et Dominus aderit desiderio suo pro bona voluntate, quam specialiter respicit.	Alas! how little charity, what flagging devotion, have they who so lightly put off Holy Communion. How happy is he, how acceptable to God, who so liveth, and in such purity of conscience keepeth himself, that any day he could be ready and well inclined to communicate, if it were in his power, and might be done without the notice of others. If a man sometimes abstaineth for the sake of humility or some sound cause, he is to be commended for his reverence. But if drowsiness have taken hold of him, he ought to rouse himself and to do what in him lieth; and the Lord will help his desire for the good will which he hath, which God specially approveth.
622	4	IV.66	66	Cum vero legitime præpeditus est, habebit semper bonam voluntatem et piam intentionem communicandi: et sic non carebit fructu Sacramenti. Potest enim quilibet devotus omni die et omni hora ad spiritualem Christi Communionem salubriter et sine prohibitione accedere. Et tamen certes diebus statuto tempore Corpus sui Redemntoris cum affectuoso reverentia sacramentaliter debet suscipere et magis laudem Dei et honorem prætendere, quam suam consolationem quærere. Nam toties mystice communicat et invisibiliter, reficitur, quoties incarnationis Christi mysterium passionemque devote recolit, et in amorem ejus accenditur.	But when he is hindered by sufficient cause, yet will he ever have a good will and pious intention to communicate; and so he shall not be lacking in the fruit of the Sacrament. For any devout man is able every day and every hour to draw near to spiritual communion with Christ to his soul’s health and without hindrance. Nevertheless on certain days and at the appointed time he ought to receive the Body and Blood of his Redeemer with affectionate reverence, and rather to seek after the praise and honour of God, than his own comfort. For so often doth he communicate mystically, and is invisibly refreshed, as he devoutly calleth to mind the mystery of Christ’s incarnation and His Passion, and is inflamed with the love of Him.
623	4	IV.67	67	Qui autem se non præparat aliter, nisi instante festo vel consuetudine compellente sæpius imparatus erit. Beatus, qui se Domino in holocaustum offert, quoties celebrat, aut communicat. Non sis in celebrando nimis prolixus aut festinus; sed serva communem bonum modum eorum, cum quibus vivis. Non debes aliis generare molestiam et tædium, sed communem serva viam secundum amorem institutionum, et potius aliorum servire utilitati, quam propriæ devotini, vel affectui.	He who only prepareth himself when a festival is at hand or custom compelleth, will too often be unprepared. Blessed is he who offereth himself to God for a whole burnt-offering, so often as he celebrateth or communicateth! Be not too slow nor too hurried in thy celebrating, but preserve the good received custom of those with whom thou livest. Thou oughtest not to produce weariness and annoyance in others, but to observe the received custom, according to the institution of the elders; and to minister to the profit of others rather than to thine own devotion or feeling.
624	4	IV.68	68	Quod Corpus Christi, et sacra Scriptura sunt animæ fideli necessaria.	XI That the Body and Blood of Christ and the Holy Scriptures are most necessary to a faithful soul
625	4	IV.69	69	Dulcissime Domine Jesu, quanta est dulcedo devotæ animæ tecum epulantis in convivio tuo. Ubi ei non alius cibus manducandus proponitur nisi tu unicus dilectus ejus, super omnia desideria cordis desiderabilies. Et mihi quidem dulce foret in præsentia tua ex intimo affectu lacrymas fundere, et cum pia Magdalena pedes tuos lacrymis irrigare. Sed ubi est hæc devotio? Ubi lacrymarum sanctarum copiosa effusio? Certe in conspectu tuo et sanctorum Angelorum tuorum cor meum ardere deberet et ex gaudio flere. Habeo enim te in Sacramento vere præsentem, quamvis aliena specie occultatum.	O most sweet Lord Jesus, how great is the blessedness of the devout soul that feedeth with Thee in Thy banquet, where there is set before it no other food than Thyself its only Beloved, more to be desired than all the desires of the heart? And to me it would verily be sweet to pour forth my tears in Thy presence from the very bottom of my heart, and with the pious Magdalene to water Thy feet with my tears. But where is this devotion? Where the abundant flowing of holy tears? Surely in Thy presence and in the presence of the holy Angels my whole heart ought to burn and to weep for joy; for I have Thee in the Sacrament verily present, although hidden under other form.
626	4	IV.70	70	Nam in propria et divina claritate te conspicere oculi mei ferre non possunt, sed neque totus mundus in fulgore gloriæ majestatis tuæ subsisteret. In hoc ergo meæ imbecillitati consulis, quod te sub Sacramento abscondis. Habeo vere et adoro, quem Angeli adorant in cælo; sed ego interim adhuc in fide, illi autem in specie et sine velamine. Me oportet contentum esse in lumine veræ fidei, et in ea ambulare,donec aspiret diesæternæ claritatis,et umbræfiguraruminclinentur. Cum autem venerit, quod perfectum est,cessabit usus Sacramentorum, quia Beati in gloria cælesti non egent medicamine sacramentali. Gaudent enim sine fine in præsentia Dei, facie ad faciem gloriam ejus speculantes, et de claritate in claritatem abyssi Deitatis transformati, gustant verbum Dei, carnem factum; sicut fuit ab initio et manet in æternum.	For in Thine own Divine brightness, mine eyes could not endure to behold Thee, neither could the whole world stand before the splendour of the glory of Thy Majesty. In this therefore Thou hast consideration unto my weakness, that Thou hidest Thyself under the Sacrament. I verily possess and adore Him whom the Angels adore in heaven; I yet for a while by faith, but they by sight and without a veil. It is good for me to be content with the light of true faith, and to walk therein until the day of eternal brightness dawn, and the shadows of figures flee away. But when that which is perfect is come, the using of Sacraments shall cease, because the Blessed in heavenly glory have no need of Sacramental remedy. For they rejoice unceasingly in the presence of God, beholding His glory face to face, and being changed from glory to glory of the infinite God, they taste the Word of God made flesh, as He was in the beginning and remaineth for everlasting.
627	4	IV.71	71	Memor horum mirabilium, grave mihi sit tædium, etiam vel quodlibet spirituale solatium, et quamdiu Dominum meum aperte in sua gloria non video, pro nihilo duco, omne quod in mundo conspicio et audio. Testis es, mi Deus, quod nulla potest me res consolari, nulla creatura quietare, nisi tu, Deus meus, quem desidero æternaliter contemplari. Sed non est hoc possibile durante me in hac mortalitate: et ideo oportet ut me ponam ad magnam patientiam, et meipsum in omni desiderio tibi submittam. Nam et Sancti tui, Domine, qui tecum jam in regno cælorum exultant in fide et patientia magna, dum viverent, adventum gloriæ tuæ expectabant. Quod illi crediderunt, ego credo; quod illi speraverunt, ego spero; quo illi pervenerunt, per gratiam tuam me venturum confido. Ambulabo interim in fide, exemplis confortatus Sanctorum. Habebo etiam libros sanctos pro solatio et vitæ speculo, atque super hæc omnia sacratissimum Corpus tuum pro singulari remedio et refrigerio.	When I think on these wondrous things, even spiritual comfort whatsoever it be becometh sore weariness to me; for so long as I see not openly my Lord in His own Glory, I count for nothing all which I behold and hear in the world. Thou, O God, art my witness that nothing is able to comfort me, no creature is able to give me rest, save Thou, O my God, whom I desire to contemplate everlastingly. But this is not possible, so long as I remain in this mortal state. Therefore ought I to set myself unto great patience, and submit myself unto Thee in every desire. For even Thy Saints, O Lord, who now rejoice with Thee in the kingdom of heaven, waited for the coming of Thy glory whilst they lived here, in faith and great glory. What they believed, that believe I; what they hoped, I hope; whither they have attained to, thither through Thy grace hope I to come. I will walk meanwhile in faith, strengthened by the examples of the Saints. I will have also holy books for comfort and for a mirror of life, and above them all Thy most holy Body and Blood shall be for me a special remedy and refuge.
628	4	IV.72	72	Duo namque mihi necessaria permaxime sentio in hac vita, sine quibus mihi importabilis foret ista miserabilis vitia. In carcere corporis hujus detentus egere duobus fateor, cibo scilicet, et lumine. Dedisti itaque mihi infirmo sacrum Corpus tuum ad refectionem mentis et corporis, et posuistilucernam pedibus meis verbum tuum. Sine his duobus bene vivere non possem: nam verbum Dei lux est animæ, et Sacramentum tuum panis vitæ. Hæc possunt etiam dici mensæ duæ, hinc et inde in Gazophylacio sanctæ Ecclesiæ positæ. Una mensa est sacri altaris, habens panem sanctum, idest Corpus Christi prætiosum. Altera est divinæ legis continens doctrinam sanctam, erudiens fidem rectam, et firmiter usque ad interiora velaminis, ubi sunt sancta sanctorum, perducens.	For two things do I feel to be exceedingly necessary to me in this life, without which this miserable life would be intolerable to me; being detained in the prison of this body, I confess that I need two things, even food and light. Thou hast therefore given to me who am so weak, Thy sacred Body and Blood, for the refreshing of my soul and body, and hast set Thy Word for a lantern to my feet . Without these two I could not properly live; for the Word of God is the light of my soul, and Thy Sacrament the bread of life. These may also be called the two tables, placed on this side and on that, in the treasury of Thy holy Church. One table is that of the Sacred Altar, bearing the holy bread, that is the precious Body and Blood of Christ; the other is the table of the Divine Law, containing holy doctrine, teaching the true faith, and leading steadfastly onwards even to that which is within the veil, where the Holy of Holies is.
629	4	IV.73	73	Gratias tibi, bone Jesu, lux lucis æternæ, pro doctrinæ sacræ mensa, quam nobis, per servos tuos Prophetas, et Apostolos aliosque Doctores ministrasti. Gratias tibi, Salvator et Creator hominum, qui ad declarandam toti mundo charitatem tuam cœ nam parasti magnam, in qua non agnum typicum, sed tuum Corpus sanctissimum, et Sanguinem proposuisti ad manducandum: læ tificans omnes fideles convivio sacro, et calice inebrians salutari, in quo sunt omnes deliciæ Paradisi; et epulantur nobiscum Angeli sancti, sed suavitate feliciori.	Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, Light of Light everlasting, for that table of holy doctrine which Thou has furnished unto us by Thy servants the Prophets and Apostles and other teachers. Thanks be to Thee, O Creator and Redeemer of men, who to make known Thy love to the whole world has prepared a great supper, in which Thou hast set forth for good not the typical lamb, but Thine own most Holy Body and Blood; making all Thy faithful ones joyful with this holy banquet and giving them to drink the cup of salvation, wherein are all the delights of Paradise, and the holy Angels do feed with us, and with yet happier sweetness.
630	4	IV.74	74	O quam mangum et honorabile est officium Sacerdotum, quibus datum est Dominum majestatis verbis sacris consecrare, labiis benedicere, manibus tenere, ore proprio sumere, et cæ teris ministrare. O, quam mundæ debent esse manus illæ , quam purum os, quam sanctum corpus, quam immaculatum cor Sacerdotis, ad quem toties ingreditur Auctor puritatis. Ex ore Sacerdotis non nisi sanctum, nisi honestum et utile procedere debet verbum qui tam sæ pe Christi accipit Sacramentum.	Oh how great and honourable is the office of the priests, to whom it is given to consecrate the Sacrament of the Lord of majesty with holy words, to bless it with the lips, to hold it in their hands, to receive it with their own mouth, and to administer it to others! Oh how clean ought those hands to be, how pure the mouth, how holy the body, how unspotted the heart of the priest, to whom so often the Author of purity entereth in! From the mouth of the priest ought naught to proceed but what is holy, what is honest and profitable, because he so often receiveth the Sacrament of Christ.
631	4	IV.75	75	Oculi ejus simplices et pudici, qui Christi Corpus solent intueri. Manus puræ et in cæ lum elevatæ , quæ Creatorem cæ li, et terræ solent contractare. Sacerdotibus specialiter in Lege dicitur: Sancti estote, quoniam ego sanctus sum, Dominus Deus vester.	His eyes ought to be single and pure, seeing they are wont to look upon the Body of Christ; the hands should be pure and lifted towards heaven, which are wont to hold within them the Creator of heaven and earth. To priests is it specially said in the Law, Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.
632	4	IV.76	76	Adjuvet nos gratia tua omnipotens Deus, ut qui officium sacerdotale suscepimus, digne ac devote tibi omni puritate et conscientia bona famulari valeamus. Et si non possumus in tanta innocentia vitæ conversari ut debemus, concede nobis tamen digne flere mala quæ gessimus, ut in spiritu humilitatis ac bonæ voluntatis proposito tibi ferventius de cætero deservire valeamus.	Assist us with Thy grace, O Almighty God, that we who have taken upon us the priestly office, may be able to converse worthily and devoutly with Thee in all purity and good conscience. And if we are not able to have our conversation in such innocency of life as we ought, yet grant unto us worthily to lament the sins which we have committed, and in the spirit of humility and full purpose of a good will, to serve Thee more earnestly for the future.
633	4	IV.77	77	Quod magna diligentia se debeat communicaturus Christo præparare.	XII That he who is about to Communicate with Christ ought to prepare himself with great diligence
634	4	IV.78	78	Ego sum puritatis amator, et dator omnis sanctitatis. Ego cor purum quæro, et ibi est locus requietionis meæ. Para mihi cœnaculum grande stratum, et faciam apud te pascha cum discipulis meis. Si vis, veniam apud te, et apud te manebo; expurga vetus fermentum, et munda cordis tui habitaculum. Exclude totum sæculum et omnem vitiorum tumultum; sede tamquam passer solitarius in tecto, et cogita excessus tuos in amaritudine animæ tuæ. Omnis namque amans suo dilecto amatori optimum et pulcherrimum præparat locum, quia in hoc cognioscitur affectus suscipientis dilectum.	I am the Lover of purity, and Giver of sanctity. I seek a pure heart, and there is the place of My rest. Prepare for Me the larger upper room furnished, and I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples. If thou wilt that I come unto thee and abide with thee, purge out the old leaven, and cleanse the habitation of thy heart. Shut out the whole world, and all the throng of sins; sit as a sparrow alone upon the house-top, and think upon thy transgressions with bitterness of thy soul. For everyone that loveth prepareth the best and fairest place for his beloved, because hereby the affection of him that entertaineth his beloved is known.
635	4	IV.79	79	Scito tamen te non posse satisfacere huic præparationi, ex merito tuæ actionis, etiamsi per integrum annum ita te præparares, ut nihil aliud in mente haberes. Sed ex sola pietate et gratia mea permitteris ad mensam meam accedere, ac si mendicus ad prandium vocetur divitis et ille nihil aliud habeat ad retribuendem beneficiis ejus, nisi se humiliando, et gratias sibi agendo. Fac ergo quod in te est, et diligenter facito, non ex consuetundine, non ex necessitate, sed cum timore et reverentia et affectu, accipe Corpus dilecti Domini Dei tui dignantis ad te venire. Ego sum qui vocavi, Ego jussi fieri, Ego supplebo quod tibi deest. Veni et suscipe me.	Yet know thou that thou canst not make sufficient preparation out of the merit of any action of thine, even though thou shouldest prepare thyself for a whole year, and hadst nothing else in thy mind. But out of My tenderness and grace alone art thou permitted to draw nigh unto My table; as though a beggar were called to a rich man’s dinner, and had no other recompense to offer him for the benefits done unto him, but to humble himself and to give him thanks. Do therefore as much as lieth in thee, and do it diligently, not of custom, nor of necessity, but with fear, reverence, and affection, receive the Body of thy beloved Lord God, who vouchsafeth to come unto thee. I am He who hath called thee; I commanded it to be done; I will supply what is lacking to thee; come and receive Me.
636	4	IV.80	80	Cum gratiam devotionis tribuo, gratias age Deo tuo, non quia dignus es, sed qui tui misertus sum. Si non habes devotionem, sed magis te aridum sentis, insiste orationi, ingemisce, pulsa, nec desistas donec merearis micam, aut guttam gratiæ salutaris accipere. Tu mei indiges, non ego tui indigeo, nec tu me sanctificare venis, sed ego sanctificare venio et meliorare. Tu venis ut ex me sanctificeris et mihi uniaris, ut novam gratiam recipias a Deo et de novo ad emendationem accendaris. Noli negligere hanc gratiam, semper præpara cum omni diligentia cor tuum, et introduc ad te Dilectum tuum.	When I give the grace of devotion, give thanks unto thy God; it is not because thou art worthy, but because I had mercy on thee. If thou hast not devotion, but rather feelest thyself dry, be instant in prayer, cease not to groan and knock; cease not until thou prevail to obtain some crumb or drop of saving grace. Thou hast need of Me, I have no need of thee. Nor dost thou come to sanctify Me, but I come to sanctify thee and make thee better. Thou comest that thou mayest be sanctified by Me, and be united to Me; that thou mayest receive fresh grace, and be kindled anew to amendment of life. See that thou neglect not this grace, but prepare thy heart with all diligence, and receive thy Beloved unto thee.
637	4	IV.81	81	Oportet autem ut non solum te præpares ad devotionem ante communionem, sed etiam ut te sollicite conserves in ea post Sacramenti perceptionem. Nec minor custodia post exigitur, quam devota præparatio prius. Nam bona postmodum custodia optima iterum est præparatio ad majorem gratiam consequendam. Ex eo quippe valde indispositus quis redditur, si statim fuerit nimis effusus ad exteriora solatia. Cave a multiloquio; mane in secreto et fruere Deo tuo. Ipsum enim habes quem totus mundus tibi auferre non potest. Ego sum, cui te totum dare debes, ita ut jam ultra non in te, sed in me absque omni sollicitudine vivas.	But thou oughtest not only to prepare thyself for devotion before Communion, thou must also keep thyself with all diligence therein after receiving the Sacrament; nor is less watchfulness needed afterwards, than devout preparation beforehand: for good watchfulness afterwards becometh in turn the best preparation for the gaining more grace. For hereby is a man made entirely indisposed to good, if he immediately return from Communion to give himself up to outward consolations. Beware of much speaking; remain in a secret place, and hold communion with thy God; for thou hast Him whom the whole world cannot take away from thee. I am He to whom thou oughtest wholly to give thyself; so that now thou mayest live not wholly in thyself, but in Me, free from all anxiety.
638	4	IV.82	82	Quod toto corde anima devota Christi unionem in Sacramento affectare debet.	XIII That the devout soul ought with the whole heart to yearn after union with Christ in the Sacrament
639	4	IV.83	83	Quis mihi det, Domine, ut inveniam te solum, ut aperiam tibi totum cor meum, ut fruar te sicut desiderat anima. Et jam nemo me despiciat, nec ulla creatura me moveat vel respiciat; sed tu solus mihi loquaris, et ego tibi, sicut solet dilectus ad dilectum, loqui et amicus cum amico convivari? Hoc oro, hoc desidero, ut tibi totus uniar, et cor meum ab omnibus creatis rebus abstraham; magisque per sacram Communionem, ac frequentem celebrationem cælestia et æterna sapere discam. At, Domine Deus, quando ero tecum totus unitus et absorptus, meique totaliter oblitus? Tu in me et ego in te et sic nos in unum pariter manere concede.	Who shall grant unto me, O Lord, that I may find Thee alone, and open all my heart unto Thee, and enjoy Thee as much as my soul desireth; and that no man may henceforth look upon me, nor any creature move me or have respect unto me, but Thou alone speak unto me and I unto Thee, even as beloved is wont to speak unto beloved, and friend to feast with friend? For this do I pray, this do I long for, that I may be wholly united unto Thee, and may withdraw my heart from all created things, and by means of Holy Communion and frequent celebration may learn more and more to relish heavenly and eternal things. Ah, Lord God, when shall I be entirely united and lost in Thee, and altogether forgetful of myself? Thou in me, and I in Thee; even so grant that we may in like manner continue together in one.
640	4	IV.84	84	Vere, vere tu esdilectus meus, electus ex millibus, in quo complacuit animæ meæ habitare omnibus diebus vitæ suæ. Vere tu es pacificus meus, in quo pax summa et requies vera, extra quem labor et dolor et infinita miseria. Vere tu esDeus absconditus, et consilium tuum non est cum impiis, sed cum humilibus et simplicibus sermo tuus. O, quam suavis est, Domine, spiritus tuus, qui, ut dulcedinem tuam in filios demonstrares, pane suavissimo de cælo descendente illos reficere dignaris. Verenon est alia natio tam grandis, quæ habeat Deos appropinquante sibi, sicut tu, Deus noster, adesuniversis fidelibus tuis: quibus ob quotidianum solatium, et cor erigendum in cælum, te tribuis ad edendum et fruendum.	Verily Thou art my Beloved, the choicest among ten thousand, in whom my soul delighteth to dwell all the days of her life. Verily Thou art my Peacemaker, in Whom is perfect peace and true rest, apart from Whom is labour and sorrow and infinite misery. Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself, and Thy counsel is not with the wicked, but Thy Word is with the humble and the simple. O how sweet, O Lord, is Thy spirit, who that Thou mightest manifest Thy sweetness towards Thy children, dost vouchsafe to refresh them with the bread which is full of sweetness, which cometh down from heaven. Verily there is no other nation so great, which hath its gods drawing nigh to them, as Thou, our God, art present unto all Thy faithful ones, unto whom for their daily solace, and for lifting up their heart unto heaven, Thou givest Thyself for their food and delight.
641	4	IV.85	85	Quæ est enim alia gens tam inclyta, sicut plebs Christiana? Aut quæ creatura sub cælo tam dilecta ut anima devota, ad quam ingreditur Deus, ut pascat eam carne sua gloriosa? O, ineffabilis gratia. O, admirabilis dignatio. O, amor immensus, homini singulariter impensus. Sed quid retribuam Domino pro gratia ista? pro charitate tam eximia? Non est aliud quod gratius donare queam, quam ut cor meum Deo meo totaliter tribuam, et intime conjungam. Tunc exultabant omnia interiora mea, cum perfecte fuerit unita Deo anima mea. Tunc dicet mihi: Si tu vis esse mecum, ego volo esse tecum. Et ego respondebo illi: Dignare, Domine manere mecum, ego volo libenter esse tecum. Hoc est totum desiderium meum, ut cor meum tibi sit unitum.	For what other nation is there so renowned as the Christian people? Or what creature is so beloved under heaven as the devout soul to which God entereth in, that he may feed it with His glorious flesh? O unspeakable grace! O wonderful condescension! O immeasurable love specially bestowed upon men! But what reward shall I give unto the Lord for this grace, for charity so mighty? There is nothing which I am able to present more acceptable than to give my heart altogether unto God, and to join it inwardly to Him. Then all my inward parts shall rejoice, when my soul shall be perfectly united unto God. Then shall He say unto me, “If thou wilt be with Me, I will be with thee.” And I will answer Him, “Vouchsafe, O Lord, to abide with me, I will gladly be with Thee; this is my whole desire, even that my heart be united unto Thee.”
642	4	IV.86	86	De quorumdam devotorum ardenti desiderio ad Corpus Christi.	XIV Of the fervent desire of certain devout persons to receive the Body and Blood of Christ
643	4	IV.87	87	Quam magna multitudo dulcedinis tuæ, Domine,quam abscondisti timentibus te.Quando recordor devotorum aliquorum ad Sacramentum tuum, Domine, cum magna devotione, et affectu accendentium, tunc sæpius in memetipso confundor et erubesco, quod ad altare tuum et sacræ Communionis mensam tam tepide et frigide accedo, quod ita aridus sine devotione et affectione cordis maneo, et quod non sum totaliter accensus, coram te, Deo meo, nec ita vehementer attractus et affectionatus, sicut multi devoti fuerunt, qui præ nimio desiderio Communionis et sensibili cordis amore a fletu non potuerunt se continere. Sed ore cordis et corporis pariter ad te, fontem vivum, medullitus inhiabant, suam esuriem non valentes aliter temperare nec satiare, nisi Corpus tuum cum omni jucunditate et spirituali aviditate accepissent.	O how great is the abundance of Thy sweetness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee. When I call to mind some devout persons who draw nigh to Thy Sacrament, O Lord, with the deepest devotion and affection, then very often I am confounded in myself and blush for shame, that I approach Thine altar and table of Holy Communion so carelessly and coldly, that I remain so dry and without affection, that I am not wholly kindled with love before Thee, my God, nor so vehemently drawn and affected as many devout persons have been, who out of the very earnest desire of the Communion, and tender affection of heart, could not refrain from weeping, but as it were with mouth of heart and body alike panted inwardly after Thee, O God, O Fountain of Life, having no power to appease or satiate their hunger, save by receiving Thy Body with all joyfulness and spiritual eagerness.
644	4	IV.88	88	O, vere ardens fides eorum probabile existens argumentum sacræ præsentiæ tuæ. Isti enim veraciter cognoscunt Dominum suum in fractione panis, quorum cor tam valide ardet in eis de Jesu ambulante cum eis. Longe, proh dolor, est a me sæpe talis affectus, et devotio tam vehemens ardor. Esto mihi propitius, bone Jesu, et dulcis et benigne; concede pauperi mendico tuo vel interdum modicum de cordiali affectione amoris tui in sacra Communione sentire, ut fides mea magis convalescat, spes in bonitate tua proficiat, et charitas semel perfecte accensa et cæleste manna experta, nunquam deficiat.	O truly ardent faith of those, becoming a very proof of Thy Sacred Presence! For they verily know their Lord in the breaking of bread, whose heart so ardently burneth within them when Jesus walketh with them by the way. Ah me! far from me for the most part is such love and devotion as this, such vehement love and ardour. Be merciful unto me, O Jesus, good, sweet, and kind, and grant unto Thy poor suppliant to feel sometimes, in Holy Communion, though it be but a little, the cordial affection of Thy love, that my faith may grow stronger, my hope in Thy goodness increase, and my charity, once kindled within me by the tasting of the heavenly manna, may never fail.
645	4	IV.89	89	Potens est autem misericordia tua etiam gratiam desideratam mihi præstare, et in spiritu ardoris, cum dies beneplaciti tui adveniret, me clementissime visitare. Etenim licet tanto desiderio tam specialium devotorum tuorum non ardeo, tamen de gratia tua illius magni inflamati desiderii desiderium habeo: orans et desiderans omnium talium fervidorum amatorum tuorum participem me fieri, ac eorum sancto consortio annumerari.	But Thy mercy is able even to grant me the grace which I long for, and to visit me most tenderly with the spirit of fervour when the day of Thy good pleasure shall come. For, although I burn not with desire so vehement as theirs who are specially devout towards Thee, yet, through Thy grace, I have a desire after that greatly inflamed desire, praying and desiring to be made partaker with all those who so fervently love Thee, and to be numbered among their holy company.
646	4	IV.90	90	Quod gratia devotionis humilitate, et sui ipsius abnegatine acquiritur.	XV That the grace of devotion is acquired by humility and self-denial
647	4	IV.91	91	Oportet te devotionis gratiam instanter quærere, desideranter petere, patienter et fiducialiter exspectare, gratanter recipere, humiliter conservare, studiose cum ea operari, ac Deo tempus et modum supernæ visitationis, donec veniat, committere. Humiliare præcipue te debes, cum parum, aut nihil devotionis interius sentis, sed non nimium dejici, nec inordinate contristari. Dat sæpe Deus in uno brevi momento, quod longo negavit tempore. Dat quandoque in fine, quod in principio orationis distulit dare.	Thou oughtest to seek earnestly the grace of devotion, to ask it fervently, to wait for it patiently and faithfully, to receive it gratefully, to preserve it humbly, to work with it diligently, and to leave to God the time and manner of heavenly visitation until it come. Chiefly oughtest thou to humble thyself when thou feelest inwardly little or no devotion, yet not to be too much cast down, nor to grieve out of measure. God ofttimes giveth in one short moment what He hath long time denied; He sometimes giveth at the end what at the beginning of prayer He hath deferred to give.
648	4	IV.92	92	Si semper cito gratia daretur, et pro voto adesset, non esset infirmo homini bene portabile. Propterea in bona spe et humili patientia exspectanda est devotionis gratia. Tibi tamen, et peccatis tuis imputa, cum non datur vel etiam occulte tolitur. Modicum quandoque est quod gratiam impedit et abscondit, si tamen modicum et non potius grande dici debeatur, quod tantum bonum prohibet. Sed si hoc ipsum modicum vel grande amoveris et perfecte viceris, erit quod petiisti.	If grace were always given immediately, and were at hand at the wish, it would be hardly bearable to weak man. Wherefore the grace of devotion is to be waited for with a good hope and with humble patience. Yet impute it to thyself and to thy sins when it is not given, or when it is mysteriously taken away. It is sometimes a small thing which hindereth and hideth grace; (if indeed that ought to be called small and not rather great , which hindereth so great a good); but if thou remove this, be it small or great, and perfectly overcome it, thou wilt have what thou hast asked.
649	4	IV.93	93	Statim namque ut te Deo ex toto corde tradideris, nec hoc vel illud pro tuo libitu seu velle quæsieris, sed integre te in illo posueris, unitum te invenies et pacatum, quia nihil ita tibi sapiet et placebit, sicut beneplacitum divinæ voluntatis. Quisquis ergo intentionem suam simplici corde sursum ad Deum levaverit, seque ab omni inordinato amore, seu displicentia cujuslibet rei creatæ evacuaverit, aptissimus gratiæ percipiendæ, ac dignus devotionis munere erit: dat enim Dominus ibi benedictionem suam, ubi vasa vacua invenerit, et quanto perfectius infimis quis renunciaverit, et magis sibi ipsi per contemtum sui moritur, tanto gratia celerius enit, copiosius intrat, et altius cor liberum elevat.	For immediately that thou hast given thyself unto God with all thine heart, and hast sought neither this nor that according to thine own will and pleasure, but hast altogether settled thyself in Him, thou shalt find thyself united and at peace; because nothing shall give thee so sweet relish and delight, as the good pleasure of the Divine will. Whosoever therefore shall have lifted up his will unto God with singleness of heart, and shall have delivered himself from every inordinate love or dislike of any created thing, he will be the most fit for receiving grace, and worthy of the gift of devotion. For where the Lord findeth empty vessels, there giveth He His blessing. And the more perfectly a man forsaketh things which cannot profit, and the more he dieth to himself, the more quickly doth grace come, the more plentifully doth it enter in, and the higher doth it lift up the free heart.
650	4	IV.94	94	Tunc videbit et affluet et mirabitur et dilatabitur cor ejus in ipso, quia manus Domini cum illo est, et ipse se posuit totaliter in manu ejus usque in sæculum. Ecce sic benedicetur homo, qui quærit Deum in toto corde suo, nec in vanum accipit animam suam. Hic in accipiendo sacram Eucharistiam magnam promeretur divinæ unionis gratiam, quia non respicit ad propriam devotionem et consolationem, sed ad Dei gloriam et honorem.	Then shall he see, and flow together, and wonder, and his heart shall be enlarged within him, because the hand of the Lord is with him, and he hath put himself wholly in His hand, even for ever. Lo, thus shall the man be blessed, that seeketh God with all his heart, and receiveth not his soul in vain. This man in receiving the Holy Eucharist obtaineth the great grace of Divine Union; because he hath not regard to his own devotion and comfort, but, above all devotion and comfort, to the glory and honour of God.
651	4	IV.95	95	Quod necessitates nostras Christo aperire debemus et ejus gratiam postulare.	XVI That we ought to lay open our necessities to Christ and to require His Grace
652	4	IV.96	96	Dulcissime atque amantissime Domine, quem nunc devote desidero suscipere, tu scis infirmitatem meam et necessitatem quam patior, in quantis malis et vitiis jaceo; quam sæpe sum gravatus, tentatus, turbatus et inquinatus. Pro remedio ad te venio, pro consolatione et sublevamine te deprecor: ad omnia scientem loquor, cui manifesta sunt omnia interiora mea, et qui solus potes me perfecte consolare et adjuvare. Tu scis quibus bonis indigeo præ omnibus et quam pauper sum in virtutibus.	O most sweet and loving Lord, whom now I devoutly desire to receive, Thou knowest my infirmity and the necessity which I suffer, in what evils and vices I lie; how often I am weighed down, tempted, disturbed, and defiled. I come unto Thee for remedy, I beseech of Thee consolation and support. I speak unto Thee who knowest all things, to whom all my secrets are open, and who alone art able perfectly to comfort and help me. Thou knowest what good thing I most stand in need of, and how poor I am in virtues.
653	4	IV.97	97	Ecce sto ante te pauper et nudus, gratiam postulans et misericordiam implorans: refice esurientem mendicum tuum, accende frigiditatem meam igne amoris tui, illumina cæcitatem meam claritate præsentiæ tuæ. Verte mihi omnia terrena in amaritudinem, omnia gravia et contraria in patientiam, omnia infima et creata in contemtum et oblivionem. Erige cor meum ad te in cælum, et ne dimittas me vagari super terram. Tu solus mihi ex hoc jam dulcescas usque in sæculum, quia tu solus cibus et potus meus, amor meus et gaudium meum, dulcedo mea et totum bonum meum.	Behold, I stand poor and naked before Thee, requiring grace, and imploring mercy. Refresh the hungry suppliant, kindle my coldness with the fire of Thy love, illuminate my blindness with the brightness of Thy presence. Turn thou all earthly things into bitterness for me, all grievous and contrary things into patience, all things worthless and created into contempt and oblivion. Lift up my heart unto Thee in Heaven, and suffer me not to wander over the earth. Be Thou alone sweet unto me from this day forward for ever, because Thou alone art my meat and drink, my love and joy, my sweetness and my whole good.
654	4	IV.98	98	Utinam me totaliter ex tua præsentia accends, comburas, et in te transmutes: ut unus tecum efficiar spiritus per gratiam internæ unionis, et liquefactionem ardentis amoris. Ne patiaris me jejunum et aridum a te recedere, sed operare mecum misericorditer, sicut sæpius expertus es cum Sanctis tuis mirabiliter. Quid mirum si totus ex te cognoscerem, et in me ipso deficerem, cum tu sis ignis semper ardens et nunquam deficiens, amor corda purificans et intellectum illuminans.	Oh that Thou wouldest altogether by Thy presence, kindle, consume, and transform me into Thyself; that I may be made one spirit with Thee, by the grace of inward union, and the melting of earnest love! Suffer me not to go away from Thee hungry and dry; but deal mercifully with me, as oftentimes Thou hast dealt wondrously with Thy saints. What marvel if I should be wholly kindled from Thee, and in myself should utterly fail, since Thou art fire always burning and never failing, love purifying the heart and enlightening the understanding.
655	4	IV.99	99	De ardenti amore, et desiderio vehementi suscipiendi Christum.	XVII Of fervent love and vehement desire of receiving Christ
656	4	IV.100	100	Cum summa devotione et ardenti amore cum toto cordis affectu et fervore desidero te, Domine; quemadmodum multi Sancti et devotæ personæ in communicando et desideraverunt, qui tibi maxime in sanctitate vitæ placuerunt, et in ardentissima devotione fuerunt. O Deus meus, amor æternus, totum bonum meum, felicitas interminabilis: cupio te suscipere cum vehementissimo desiderio et dignissima reverentia, quam aliquis Sanctorum unquam habuit et sentire potuit.	With the deepest devotion and fervent love, with all affection and fervour of heart, I long to receive Thee, O Lord, even as many Saints and devout persons have desired Thee in communicating, who were altogether well pleasing to Thee by their sanctity of life, and dwelt in all ardent devotion. O my God, Eternal Love, my whole Good, Happiness without measure, I long to receive Thee with the most vehement desire and becoming reverence which any Saint ever had or could have.
657	4	IV.101	101	Et licet indignus sum omnia illa sentimenta devotionis habere, tamen offero tibi totum cordis mei affectum, ac si omnia illa gratissime inflammata desideria solus haberem. Sed et quæcumque potest pia mens concipere et desiderare, hæc omnia tibi cum summa veneratione et intimo servore præbeo et offero. Nihil opto reservare mihi, sed me et omnia mea tibi sponte et libentissime immolare. Domine Deus meus, creator meus et redemtor meus, cum tali gratitudine, dignitate et amore, cum tali spe, fide, et puritate affecto te hodie suscipere, sicut te suscepti et desideravit sanctissima Mater tua, gloriosa Virgo Maria, quando Angelo evangelizanti sibi incarnationis tuæ mysterium humiliter et devote respondit:Ecce ancilla Domini, fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum.	And although I be unworthy to have all those feelings of devotion, yet do I offer Thee the whole affection of my heart, even as though I alone had all those most grateful inflamed desires. Yea, also, whatsoever things a pious mind is able to conceive and long for, all these with the deepest veneration and inward fervour do I offer and present unto Thee. I desire to reserve nothing unto myself, but freely and entirely to offer myself and all that I have unto Thee for a sacrifice. O Lord my God, my Creator and Redeemer! with such affection, reverence, praise, and honour, with such gratitude, worthiness, and love, with such faith, hope, and purity do I desire to receive Thee this day, as Thy most blessed Mother, the glorious Virgin Mary, received and desired Thee, when she humbly and devoutly answered the Angel who brought unto her the glad tidings of the mystery of the Incarnation. Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.
658	4	IV.102	102	Et sicut beatus Præcursor tuus excellentissimus Sanctorum, Johannes Baptista, in præsentia tua lætabundus exultavit in gaudio Spiritus Sancti, dum adhuc maternis clauderetur visceribus. Et postmodum cernens inter homines Jesum ambulantem, valde se humilians, devoto cum affectu dicebat:Amicus autem sponsi, qui stat et audit cum gaudio, gaudet propter vocem sponsi:sic et ego magnis et sacris desideriis opto inflammari, et tibi ex toto corde me ipsum præsentare. Unde et omnium devotorum cordium jubilationes, ardentes affectus, mentales excessus, ac supernales illuminationes et cælica visiones tibi offero et exhibeo cum omnibus virtutibus et laudibus, ab omni creatura in cælo et in terra celebratis et celebrandis, pro me et omnibus mihi in oratione commendatis, quatenus ab omnibus digne lauderis, et in perpetuum glorificeris.	And as Thy blessed forerunner, the most excellent of Saints, John Baptist, being full of joy in Thy presence, leapt while yet in the womb of his mother, for joy in the Holy Ghost; and afterwards discerning Jesus walking amongst men, humbled himself exceedingly, and said, with devout affection, The friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice; even so I wish to be inflamed with great and holy desires, and to present myself unto Thee with my whole heart. Whence also, on behalf of myself and of all commended to me in prayer, I offer and present unto Thee the jubilation of all devout hearts, their ardent affections, their mental ecstasies, and supernatural illuminations and heavenly visions, with all the virtues and praises celebrated and to be celebrated by every creature in heaven and earth; to the end that by all Thou mayest worthily be praised and glorified for ever.
659	4	IV.103	103	Accipe vota mea, Domine Deus meus, et desideria infinitæ laudationis et immensæ benedictionis, quætibi secundum multitudinem ineffabilis magnitudinis tuæ jure debentur. Hæc tibi reddo et reddere desidero per singulos dies et momenta temporum, atque ad reddendum mecum tibi gratias et laudes, omnes cælestes spiritus et cunctos fideles tuos precibus et affectibus invito et exoro.	Receive my prayers, O Lord my God, and my desires of giving Thee infinite praise and unbounded benediction, which, according to the multitude of Thine unspeakable greatness, are most justly due unto Thee. These do I give Thee, and desire to give every day and every moment; and with beseechings and affectionate desires I call upon all celestial spirits and all Thy faithful people to join with me in rendering Thee thanks and praises.
660	4	IV.104	104	Laudent te universi populi, tribus, et linguæ, et sanctum et mellifluum nomen tuum cum summa devotione et ardenti jubilatione magnificent. Et quicumque reverenter ac devote altissimum Sacramentum tuum celebrant et plena fide recipiunt, gratiam et misericordiam apud te invenire mereantur, et pro me peccatore suppliciter exorent. Cumque optata devotione ac fruibili unione potiti fuerint, et bene consolati, ac mirifice refecti de sacra mensa cælesti abscesserint mei pauperis recordari dignentur.	Let all peoples, nations, and tongues praise Thee, and magnify Thy holy and sweet-sounding Name, with highest jubilations and ardent devotion. And let all who reverently and devoutly celebrate Thy most high Sacrament, and receive it with full assurance of faith, be accounted worthy to find grace and mercy with Thee, and intercede with all supplication for me a sinner; and when they shall have attained unto their wished-for devotion and joyous union with Thee, and shall depart full of comfort and wondrously refreshed from Thy holy, heavenly table, let them vouchsafe to be mindful of me, for I am poor and needy.
661	4	IV.105	105	Quod homo non sit curiosus scrutator Sacramenti, sed humilis imitator Christi, subdendo sensum suum sacræ fidei.	XVIII That a man should not be a curious searcher of the Sacrament, but a humble imitator of Christ, submitting his sense to holy faith
662	4	IV.106	106	Cavendum est tibi a curiosa et inutili perscrutatione hujus profundissimi Sacramenti, si non vis in dubitationis profundum mergi.Qui scrutator est majestatis, opprimetur a gloria.Plus valet Deus operari, quam homo intelligere potest. Tolerabilis est pia et humilis inquisitio veritatis, parata semper doceri, et super sanas Patrum sententias studentis ambulare.	Thou must take heed of curious and useless searching into this most profound Sacrament, if thou wilt not be plunged into the abyss of doubt. He that is a searcher of Majesty shall be oppressed by the glory thereof. God is able to do more than man can understand. A pious and humble search after truth is to be allowed, when it is always ready to be taught, and striving to walk after the wholesome opinions of the fathers.
663	4	IV.107	107	Beata simplicitas, quæ difficiles quæstionum relinquit vias, et plana ac firma pergit semita mandatorum Dei. Multi devotionem perdiderunt, dum altiora scrutari voluerunt. Fides a te exigitur et sincera vita, non altitudo intellectus, neque profunditas mysteriorum Dei. Si non intelligis nec capis quæ infra te sunt, quomodo comprehendes quæ supra te sunt. Subdere Deo et humilia sensum tuum fidei, et dabitur tibi scientiæ lumen, prout tibi fuerit utile et necessarium.	Blessed is the simplicity which leaveth alone the difficult paths of questionings, and followeth the plain and firm steps of God’s commandments. Many have lost devotion whilst they sought to search into deeper things. Faith is required of thee, and a sincere life, not loftiness of intellect, nor deepness in the mysteries of God. If thou understandest not nor comprehendest the things which are beneath thee, how shalt thou comprehend those which are above thee? Submit thyself unto God, and humble thy sense to faith, and the light of knowledge shall be given thee, as shall be profitable and necessary unto thee.
664	4	IV.108	108	Quidam graviter tentantur de fide ac Sacramento, sed non est hoc ipsis imputandum, sed potius inimico. Noli curare, noli disputare cum cogitationibus tuis, nec ad immissas a diabolo disputationes et dubitationes responde. Sed crede verbis Dei. Crede Sanctis ejus et prophetis, et fugiet a te nequam inimicus. Sæpe enim ultum prodest, quod sustinet talia servus Dei. Nam infideles et peccatores non tentat, quos secure jam possidet: Fideles autem devotos variis modis tentat et vexat.	There are some who are grievously tempted concerning faith and the Sacrament; but this is not to be imputed to themselves but rather to the enemy. Care not then for this, dispute not with thine own thoughts, nor make answer to the doubts which are cast into thee by the devil; but believe the words of God, believe His Saints and Prophets, and the wicked enemy shall flee from thee. Often it profiteth much, that the servant of God endureth such things. For the enemy tempteth not unbelievers and sinners, because he already hath secure possession of them; but he tempteth and harasseth the faithful and devout by various means.
665	4	IV.109	109	Perge ergo cum simplici et indubitata fide, et cum simplici reverentia ad Sacramentum accede. Quidquid intelligere non vales, Deo omnipotenti secure committe. Non fallit te Deus; fallitur qui sibi nimium credit. Graditur Deus cum simplicibus, revelat se humilibus, dat intellectum parvulis, aperit sensum puris mentibus, et abscondit gratiam curiosis et superbis. Ratio humana debilis est, et falli potest; fides autem vera falli non potest.	Go forward therefore with simple and undoubting faith, and draw nigh unto the Sacrament with supplicating reverence. And whatsoever thou art not enabled to understand, that commit without anxiety to Almighty God. God deceiveth thee not; he is deceived who believeth too much in himself. God walketh with the simple, revealeth Himself to the humble, giveth understanding to babes, openeth the sense to pure minds, and hideth grace from the curious and proud. Human reason is weak and may be deceived; but true faith cannot be deceived.
666	4	IV.110	110	Omnis ratio et naturalis investigatio fidem sequi debet, non præcedere, nec infringere. Nam fides et amor ibi maxime præcellunt, et occultis modis in hoc sanctissimo et superexcellentissimo Sacramento operantur. Deus æternus, et immensus, infinitæque potentiæ, facit magna et inscrutabilia in cælo et in terra; nec est investigatio mirabilium opera ejus. Si talia essent opera Dei, ut facile ab humana ratione caperentur, non essent mirabilia nec inscrutabilia dicenda.	All reason and natural investigation ought to follow faith, not to precede, nor to break it. For faith and love do here especially take the highest place, and work in hidden ways in this most holy and exceeding excellent Sacrament. God who is eternal and incomprehensible, and of infinite power, doth great and inscrutable things in heaven and in earth, and His wonderful works are past finding out. If the works of God were of such sort that they might easily be comprehended by human reason, they should no longer be called wonderful or unspeakable.
