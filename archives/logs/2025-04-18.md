## 2025-04-18 — **Transformation Milestone Reached**

Today I completed the **Transformation Phase** of the ClassicBook ETL pipeline. This marks a key milestone: the pipeline has now successfully extracted and cleaned the entire *Imitation of Christ* dataset.

### Script Update: `clean-imitation.py`

I wrote a single, modular script that processes all four TSV files (each corresponding to one book of the *Imitation*).  
Instead of cleaning each one separately, the script reads and cleans all of them and produces a single, consolidated output file:

- Output: `imitation_cleaned.tsv`

This unified file is now ready for SQL loading in the next phase.

### Ready for Loading Phase

With the data now clean and aligned, I'm moving into the **Loading Phase**, which includes:

1. **Designing a Snowflake schema** — reflecting the logical structure of the book, its chapters, and verses.
2. Creating two scripts:
   - `create_schema.sql` — to create the Snowflake-style dimension and fact tables.
   - `load_data.py` — to load the cleaned TSV data into PostgreSQL using `psycopg2`.

Next up: schema design and testing the load.
