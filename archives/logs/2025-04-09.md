# What I did today

-	Prepared the extracted Latin text to begin manual alignment with the English translation.
-	Created a Python script to split the Latin paragraphs into a spreadsheet format for easier alignment.
-   Began aligning the texts using Google Sheets for better structure and readability.

# Next steps

-   Upload the script to GitHub inside a new folder called tools/.
-   Upload the cleaned and aligned .csv file with texts organized by chapter.




## SSL Certificate Issue with Python 3.13 and Requests

### Problem
- Encountered persistent `SSLCertVerificationError` when trying to fetch HTML content from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1653/pg1653-images.html) using `requests.get()`.
- Error traceback indicated certificate expiration or failure to verify:  
  `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: certificate has expired (_ssl.c:1028)`
- Root cause traced to Python 3.13 installed via Homebrew, which does not correctly link to macOS's system certificate store.

### Attempted Fixes
- Reinstalled Python 3.13 via the official [python.org](https://www.python.org/) installer.
- Ran `/Applications/Python 3.13/Install Certificates.command` successfully.
- Deleted and recreated the `venv` using the new system Python.
- Reinstalled project dependencies.

### Final Fix
- The issue persisted due to SSL inconsistencies in the Homebrew + Python 3.13 toolchain.
- As a workaround, added `verify=False` to `requests.get()` in `extract_english.py` to bypass SSL verification **for this known-safe source**.
- Also suppressed SSL warnings using:
  ```python
  import warnings
  warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

## Sentence of the day

- “Verum est bonum intellectus, et propter hoc naturaliter appetit veritatem sicut bonum suum.”
(De Veritate, q. 1, a. 1, ad 1)

- “The true is the good of the intellect, and for this reason it naturally desires truth as its own good.”
