## What I studied today  
- Completed the **Extract** phase of the Latin text of *The Imitation of Christ*
- Parsed 4 subpages from The Latin Library using BeautifulSoup
- Collected a total of 674 cleaned and structured Latin paragraphs
- Saved output to: `raw_data/latin_kempis.txt`

## Challenges
- Pushed myself to finish this first extraction script today.

## Reflections  
This was a milestone. I feel so happy that I finished my first real-world extract phase, 
and I know exactly what it’s doing and why.  
It felt like working with precision and patience — 
and it was beautiful to see it all come together.  
This is so deeply rewarding, I mean working on a sprirtual classic.
