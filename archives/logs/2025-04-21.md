## 📘 Final Log — *Classic Book ETL Pipeline*

---

### ✅ Milestone Achieved: PROJECT COMPLETE

Today I officially finished the Classic Book ETL pipeline project. This marks a huge personal and professional milestone for me.

---

### 🧱 What I Finalized:
- Completed **all ETL phases**: Extract → Transform → Load
- Added a full **`sql/` folder**:
  - Schema creation scripts
  - Sample queries
  - Queries to explore, join, and analyze the final dataset
- Wrote or upgraded all **README files**, including:
  - `README.md` (main project)
  - `extract/README.md`
  - `transform/README.md`
  - `load/README.md`
  - `sql/README.md`
- Deleted the history of failed commits (especially Docker-related), cleaning up the Git log and giving the repository a professional polish.

---

### 🐳 Docker Attempt:
- I tried to **dockerize the pipeline**, but I realized I need to study Docker properly before implementing it.
- I’m okay with that. I took the step and learned a lot in the process.
- I’ll return to this idea in a future upgrade — or leave it for my next portfolio project.

---

### 🧠 Reflections:
- I started this journey **knowing almost nothing** about Git, Bash, pipelines, or Python for ETL.
- I built this project using **AI as a learning companion**.
- I now understand what version control really means, what it takes to make a repo usable by others, and how to *engineer* something real from a classic text.
- I am deeply **thankful to God** for giving me the clarity, strength, and discipline to complete this — often waking up at 5 AM to work on this project before my job in retail.
- I am proud of myself. This is not just a technical project — it’s proof that I can **learn**, **build**, and **ship**.
