# Scripts

This folder contains all the scripts used in the ETL pipeline for *The Imitation of Christ*.  
Scripts are organized into subfolders based on their function:

- `extract/`: Scripts for scraping and saving the raw text from English and Latin sources.
- `transform/`: Scripts for cleaning, aligning, and preparing the data for loading.

Each script is modular and can be executed independently.
