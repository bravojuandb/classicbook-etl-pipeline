# generate_latin_alignment_csv.py

I created this script to generate a template from the Latin text: 'latin_alignment_template.csv'.
 
It produces a two-column structure: on the left, the Latin text divided into individual paragraphs (one per row),  
and on the right, an empty column for the corresponding English translation.

The goal was to allow manual alignmentâ€”parsing and adapting the English text paragraph-by-paragraph  
to match the original Latin structure.
